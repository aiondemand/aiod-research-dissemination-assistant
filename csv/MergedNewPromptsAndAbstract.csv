IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this article, we have provided a brief overview of dif-
ferent commercially available Edge AI accelerators. We see a huge variety of devices based on different chips, running
different operating systems, and utilizing different AI frame-
works/runtimes. While manufacturers of all of the devices
mentioned above were able to specify the theoretical max
performance of the devices, usually, they were not able to
specify the power draw of the SBC. It is hard to make even an
educated guess on which edge devices should be used for the
specific deployment in such an environment. It is even harder
when we consider framework-specific optimizations. Another
question is the devices’ limits, for example: Are all the devices
able to run 3D convolutional networks? If not, is it due to the
intrinsic limitations of the chip design or due to the lack of
computing power? We do not know the answer to any of those
questions now.
We believe that there is a need to examine these devices
further and preferably create some kind of guidelines on
how, when, and where to deploy AI applications to achieve
maximum efficiency and low costs. In the process, it is
also necessary to introduce a more objective and less naive
division than only boards/sticks as the board category is still
vast. In order to do so, it is needed to compare them and
preferably create some curated benchmark that would be able
to encompass a significant portion of such devices. This,
however, will mean incorporating a wide variety of different
frameworks and runtimes."

New technologies bring opportunities to deploy AI and machine learning to the edge of
the network, allowing edge devices to train simple models that can then be deployed in practice.
Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique to create a global model by
learning from multiple decentralized edge clients. Although FL methods offer several advantages,
including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of
computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. Internet of Things (IoT) devices
may have limited computing resources, poorer connection quality, or may use different operating
systems. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices
with limited computational resources. This paper also presents FL frameworks that are currently
popular and that provide communication between clients and servers. In this context, various topics
are described, which include contributions and trends in the literature. This includes basic models
and designs of system architecture, possibilities of application in practice, privacy and security, and
resource management. Challenges related to the computational requirements of edge devices such as
hardware heterogeneity, communication overload or limited resources of devices are discussed.

8. Conclusions
Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa-
tional power of the devices on the edge of the network and the large and diverse datasets
to train machine learning models without compromising data privacy. Privacy is key for
applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing
these data are often impossible. Before these architectures are widely used in commonplace
applications, many research questions still need to be resolved, despite a few examples of
FL being successfully used in production settings. FL has become a cutting-edge paradigm
in response to the growing computational power of devices such as smartphones, wear-
ables, and autonomous cars, as well as worries about the security of sensitive data. Due
to the increased need for local data storage and the relocation of ML computations to end
devices while minimizing data transfer overhead, researchers have tried to implement FL
architectures in various domains. An overview of the FL paradigm, which is gaining popu-
larity, is provided in this article. We focused on the most recent materials and publications,
as we discussed FL’s fundamental architecture, communication, design, and analysis. We
discussed the basic requirements that FL must meet, the difﬁculties involved, the potential

for deployment and use in practical applications, and the frameworks with which FL is
compatible. We have focused on the overview of the frameworks and examined the oper-
ating systems they supported and the potential for deployment on various edge devices.
We discussed potential future directions for FL use in diverse IoT environments. We also
considered the problems and difﬁculties that must be solved for edge devices that are
resource-constrained and have limited computational power, even though the hardware
speciﬁcations they employ are not always listed in the literature."

This article explores the impact and benefits of digitizing health records, focusing on the care of patients lying at home in the UK.
Although electronic health records (EHRs) have existed for some time, their widespread adoption has escalated in the last decade,
revolutionizing patient care. Digitization of health records increases accessibility, improves communication between healthcare pro-
fessionals, and offers better monitoring and transparency in patient care. Through a case study of implementing a digital solution for
patients and doctors, this article aims to show how such technological advances can significantly improve patient care, reduce costs,
and provide peace of mind for patients’ families.
8. CONCLUSIONS
We have performed a analysis of modern technologies
relevant to the development of web applications. This in-
cludes an overview of the tools and frameworks for digi-
tizing health records. During the development process, we
encountered and solved various challenges, including front-
end issues related to design and user interface, as well as
back-end issues related to application architecture and inte-
gration between front-end and back-end components.
A thorough review of the paper forms was conducted,
focusing on the details and intricacies of the information
fields. After this analysis, we started designing and proto-
typing the web application so that its architecture and func-
tionalities meet the required standards. This phase also in-
cluded rigorous testing of the application’s functions.
Subsequently, we developed an efficient system for
storing information from medical records. Finally, using
the React.js and Express.js frameworks, we successfully
created a web application dedicated to digitizing medical
records. The application uses the MongoDB database for
safe and efficient data storage. This paper highlights the
advancements in web application development and enables
the provision of a functional and user-friendly digital solu-
tion for health record management."

New technologies bring opportunities to deploy AI and machine learning to the edge of
the network, allowing edge devices to train simple models that can then be deployed in practice.
Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique to create a global model by
learning from multiple decentralized edge clients. Although FL methods offer several advantages,
including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of
computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. Internet of Things (IoT) devices
may have limited computing resources, poorer connection quality, or may use different operating
systems. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices
with limited computational resources. This paper also presents FL frameworks that are currently
popular and that provide communication between clients and servers. In this context, various topics
are described, which include contributions and trends in the literature. This includes basic models
and designs of system architecture, possibilities of application in practice, privacy and security, and
resource management. Challenges related to the computational requirements of edge devices such as
hardware heterogeneity, communication overload or limited resources of devices are discussed.

8. Conclusions
Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa-
tional power of the devices on the edge of the network and the large and diverse datasets
to train machine learning models without compromising data privacy. Privacy is key for
applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing
these data are often impossible. Before these architectures are widely used in commonplace
applications, many research questions still need to be resolved, despite a few examples of
FL being successfully used in production settings. FL has become a cutting-edge paradigm
in response to the growing computational power of devices such as smartphones, wear-
ables, and autonomous cars, as well as worries about the security of sensitive data. Due
to the increased need for local data storage and the relocation of ML computations to end
devices while minimizing data transfer overhead, researchers have tried to implement FL
architectures in various domains. An overview of the FL paradigm, which is gaining popu-
larity, is provided in this article. We focused on the most recent materials and publications,
as we discussed FL’s fundamental architecture, communication, design, and analysis. We
discussed the basic requirements that FL must meet, the difﬁculties involved, the potential

for deployment and use in practical applications, and the frameworks with which FL is
compatible. We have focused on the overview of the frameworks and examined the oper-
ating systems they supported and the potential for deployment on various edge devices.
We discussed potential future directions for FL use in diverse IoT environments. We also
considered the problems and difﬁculties that must be solved for edge devices that are
resource-constrained and have limited computational power, even though the hardware
speciﬁcations they employ are not always listed in the literature."

This article explores the impact and benefits of digitizing health records, focusing on the care of patients lying at home in the UK.
Although electronic health records (EHRs) have existed for some time, their widespread adoption has escalated in the last decade,
revolutionizing patient care. Digitization of health records increases accessibility, improves communication between healthcare pro-
fessionals, and offers better monitoring and transparency in patient care. Through a case study of implementing a digital solution for
patients and doctors, this article aims to show how such technological advances can significantly improve patient care, reduce costs,
and provide peace of mind for patients’ families.
8. CONCLUSIONS
We have performed a analysis of modern technologies
relevant to the development of web applications. This in-
cludes an overview of the tools and frameworks for digi-
tizing health records. During the development process, we
encountered and solved various challenges, including front-
end issues related to design and user interface, as well as
back-end issues related to application architecture and inte-
gration between front-end and back-end components.
A thorough review of the paper forms was conducted,
focusing on the details and intricacies of the information
fields. After this analysis, we started designing and proto-
typing the web application so that its architecture and func-
tionalities meet the required standards. This phase also in-
cluded rigorous testing of the application’s functions.
Subsequently, we developed an efficient system for
storing information from medical records. Finally, using
the React.js and Express.js frameworks, we successfully
created a web application dedicated to digitizing medical
records. The application uses the MongoDB database for
safe and efficient data storage. This paper highlights the
advancements in web application development and enables
the provision of a functional and user-friendly digital solu-
tion for health record management."

IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this article, we have provided a brief overview of dif-
ferent commercially available Edge AI accelerators. We see a huge variety of devices based on different chips, running
different operating systems, and utilizing different AI frame-
works/runtimes. While manufacturers of all of the devices
mentioned above were able to specify the theoretical max
performance of the devices, usually, they were not able to
specify the power draw of the SBC. It is hard to make even an
educated guess on which edge devices should be used for the
specific deployment in such an environment. It is even harder
when we consider framework-specific optimizations. Another
question is the devices’ limits, for example: Are all the devices
able to run 3D convolutional networks? If not, is it due to the
intrinsic limitations of the chip design or due to the lack of
computing power? We do not know the answer to any of those
questions now.
We believe that there is a need to examine these devices
further and preferably create some kind of guidelines on
how, when, and where to deploy AI applications to achieve
maximum efficiency and low costs. In the process, it is
also necessary to introduce a more objective and less naive
division than only boards/sticks as the board category is still
vast. In order to do so, it is needed to compare them and
preferably create some curated benchmark that would be able
to encompass a significant portion of such devices. This,
however, will mean incorporating a wide variety of different
frameworks and runtimes."

This article explores the impact and benefits of digitizing health records, focusing on the care of patients lying at home in the UK.
Although electronic health records (EHRs) have existed for some time, their widespread adoption has escalated in the last decade,
revolutionizing patient care. Digitization of health records increases accessibility, improves communication between healthcare pro-
fessionals, and offers better monitoring and transparency in patient care. Through a case study of implementing a digital solution for
patients and doctors, this article aims to show how such technological advances can significantly improve patient care, reduce costs,
and provide peace of mind for patients’ families.
8. CONCLUSIONS
We have performed a analysis of modern technologies
relevant to the development of web applications. This in-
cludes an overview of the tools and frameworks for digi-
tizing health records. During the development process, we
encountered and solved various challenges, including front-
end issues related to design and user interface, as well as
back-end issues related to application architecture and inte-
gration between front-end and back-end components.
A thorough review of the paper forms was conducted,
focusing on the details and intricacies of the information
fields. After this analysis, we started designing and proto-
typing the web application so that its architecture and func-
tionalities meet the required standards. This phase also in-
cluded rigorous testing of the application’s functions.
Subsequently, we developed an efficient system for
storing information from medical records. Finally, using
the React.js and Express.js frameworks, we successfully
created a web application dedicated to digitizing medical
records. The application uses the MongoDB database for
safe and efficient data storage. This paper highlights the
advancements in web application development and enables
the provision of a functional and user-friendly digital solu-
tion for health record management."

IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this article, we have provided a brief overview of dif-
ferent commercially available Edge AI accelerators. We see a huge variety of devices based on different chips, running
different operating systems, and utilizing different AI frame-
works/runtimes. While manufacturers of all of the devices
mentioned above were able to specify the theoretical max
performance of the devices, usually, they were not able to
specify the power draw of the SBC. It is hard to make even an
educated guess on which edge devices should be used for the
specific deployment in such an environment. It is even harder
when we consider framework-specific optimizations. Another
question is the devices’ limits, for example: Are all the devices
able to run 3D convolutional networks? If not, is it due to the
intrinsic limitations of the chip design or due to the lack of
computing power? We do not know the answer to any of those
questions now.
We believe that there is a need to examine these devices
further and preferably create some kind of guidelines on
how, when, and where to deploy AI applications to achieve
maximum efficiency and low costs. In the process, it is
also necessary to introduce a more objective and less naive
division than only boards/sticks as the board category is still
vast. In order to do so, it is needed to compare them and
preferably create some curated benchmark that would be able
to encompass a significant portion of such devices. This,
however, will mean incorporating a wide variety of different
frameworks and runtimes."

New technologies bring opportunities to deploy AI and machine learning to the edge of
the network, allowing edge devices to train simple models that can then be deployed in practice.
Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique to create a global model by
learning from multiple decentralized edge clients. Although FL methods offer several advantages,
including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of
computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. Internet of Things (IoT) devices
may have limited computing resources, poorer connection quality, or may use different operating
systems. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices
with limited computational resources. This paper also presents FL frameworks that are currently
popular and that provide communication between clients and servers. In this context, various topics
are described, which include contributions and trends in the literature. This includes basic models
and designs of system architecture, possibilities of application in practice, privacy and security, and
resource management. Challenges related to the computational requirements of edge devices such as
hardware heterogeneity, communication overload or limited resources of devices are discussed.

8. Conclusions
Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa-
tional power of the devices on the edge of the network and the large and diverse datasets
to train machine learning models without compromising data privacy. Privacy is key for
applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing
these data are often impossible. Before these architectures are widely used in commonplace
applications, many research questions still need to be resolved, despite a few examples of
FL being successfully used in production settings. FL has become a cutting-edge paradigm
in response to the growing computational power of devices such as smartphones, wear-
ables, and autonomous cars, as well as worries about the security of sensitive data. Due
to the increased need for local data storage and the relocation of ML computations to end
devices while minimizing data transfer overhead, researchers have tried to implement FL
architectures in various domains. An overview of the FL paradigm, which is gaining popu-
larity, is provided in this article. We focused on the most recent materials and publications,

IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this article, we have provided a brief overview of dif-
ferent commercially available Edge AI accelerators. We see a huge variety of devices based on different chips, running
different operating systems, and utilizing different AI frame-
works/runtimes. While manufacturers of all of the devices
mentioned above were able to specify the theoretical max
performance of the devices, usually, they were not able to
specify the power draw of the SBC. It is hard to make even an
educated guess on which edge devices should be used for the
specific deployment in such an environment. It is even harder
when we consider framework-specific optimizations. Another
question is the devices’ limits, for example: Are all the devices
able to run 3D convolutional networks? If not, is it due to the
intrinsic limitations of the chip design or due to the lack of
computing power? We do not know the answer to any of those
questions now.
We believe that there is a need to examine these devices
further and preferably create some kind of guidelines on
how, when, and where to deploy AI applications to achieve
maximum efficiency and low costs. In the process, it is
also necessary to introduce a more objective and less naive
division than only boards/sticks as the board category is still
vast. In order to do so, it is needed to compare them and
preferably create some curated benchmark that would be able
to encompass a significant portion of such devices. This,
however, will mean incorporating a wide variety of different
frameworks and runtimes."

New technologies bring opportunities to deploy AI and machine learning to the edge of
the network, allowing edge devices to train simple models that can then be deployed in practice.
Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique to create a global model by
learning from multiple decentralized edge clients. Although FL methods offer several advantages,
including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of
computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. Internet of Things (IoT) devices
may have limited computing resources, poorer connection quality, or may use different operating
systems. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices
with limited computational resources. This paper also presents FL frameworks that are currently
popular and that provide communication between clients and servers. In this context, various topics
are described, which include contributions and trends in the literature. This includes basic models
and designs of system architecture, possibilities of application in practice, privacy and security, and
resource management. Challenges related to the computational requirements of edge devices such as
hardware heterogeneity, communication overload or limited resources of devices are discussed.

8. Conclusions
Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa-
tional power of the devices on the edge of the network and the large and diverse datasets
to train machine learning models without compromising data privacy. Privacy is key for
applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing
these data are often impossible. Before these architectures are widely used in commonplace
applications, many research questions still need to be resolved, despite a few examples of
FL being successfully used in production settings. FL has become a cutting-edge paradigm
in response to the growing computational power of devices such as smartphones, wear-
ables, and autonomous cars, as well as worries about the security of sensitive data. Due
to the increased need for local data storage and the relocation of ML computations to end
devices while minimizing data transfer overhead, researchers have tried to implement FL
architectures in various domains. An overview of the FL paradigm, which is gaining popu-
larity, is provided in this article. We focused on the most recent materials and publications,
as we discussed FL’s fundamental architecture, communication, design, and analysis. We
discussed the basic requirements that FL must meet, the difﬁculties involved, the potential

for deployment and use in practical applications, and the frameworks with which FL is
compatible. We have focused on the overview of the frameworks and examined the oper-
ating systems they supported and the potential for deployment on various edge devices.
We discussed potential future directions for FL use in diverse IoT environments. We also
considered the problems and difﬁculties that must be solved for edge devices that are
resource-constrained and have limited computational power, even though the hardware
speciﬁcations they employ are not always listed in the literature."

This article explores the impact and benefits of digitizing health records, focusing on the care of patients lying at home in the UK.
Although electronic health records (EHRs) have existed for some time, their widespread adoption has escalated in the last decade,
revolutionizing patient care. Digitization of health records increases accessibility, improves communication between healthcare pro-
fessionals, and offers better monitoring and transparency in patient care. Through a case study of implementing a digital solution for
patients and doctors, this article aims to show how such technological advances can significantly improve patient care, reduce costs,
and provide peace of mind for patients’ families.

relevant to the development of web applications. This in-
cludes an overview of the tools and frameworks for digi-
tizing health records. During the development process, we

New technologies bring opportunities to deploy AI and machine learning to the edge of
the network, allowing edge devices to train simple models that can then be deployed in practice.
Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique to create a global model by
learning from multiple decentralized edge clients. Although FL methods offer several advantages,
including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of
computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. Internet of Things (IoT) devices
may have limited computing resources, poorer connection quality, or may use different operating
systems. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices
with limited computational resources. This paper also presents FL frameworks that are currently
popular and that provide communication between clients and servers. In this context, various topics
are described, which include contributions and trends in the literature. This includes basic models
and designs of system architecture, possibilities of application in practice, privacy and security, and
resource management. Challenges related to the computational requirements of edge devices such as
hardware heterogeneity, communication overload or limited resources of devices are discussed.

8. Conclusions
Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa-
tional power of the devices on the edge of the network and the large and diverse datasets
to train machine learning models without compromising data privacy. Privacy is key for
applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing
these data are often impossible. Before these architectures are widely used in commonplace
applications, many research questions still need to be resolved, despite a few examples of
FL being successfully used in production settings. FL has become a cutting-edge paradigm
in response to the growing computational power of devices such as smartphones, wear-
ables, and autonomous cars, as well as worries about the security of sensitive data. Due
to the increased need for local data storage and the relocation of ML computations to end
devices while minimizing data transfer overhead, researchers have tried to implement FL
architectures in various domains. An overview of the FL paradigm, which is gaining popu-
larity, is provided in this article. We focused on the most recent materials and publications,
as we discussed FL’s fundamental architecture, communication, design, and analysis. We
discussed the basic requirements that FL must meet, the difﬁculties involved, the potential

for deployment and use in practical applications, and the frameworks with which FL is
compatible. We have focused on the overview of the frameworks and examined the oper-
ating systems they supported and the potential for deployment on various edge devices.
We discussed potential future directions for FL use in diverse IoT environments. We also
considered the problems and difﬁculties that must be solved for edge devices that are
resource-constrained and have limited computational power, even though the hardware
speciﬁcations they employ are not always listed in the literature."

This article explores the impact and benefits of digitizing health records, focusing on the care of patients lying at home in the UK.
Although electronic health records (EHRs) have existed for some time, their widespread adoption has escalated in the last decade,
revolutionizing patient care. Digitization of health records increases accessibility, improves communication between healthcare pro-
fessionals, and offers better monitoring and transparency in patient care. Through a case study of implementing a digital solution for
patients and doctors, this article aims to show how such technological advances can significantly improve patient care, reduce costs,
and provide peace of mind for patients’ families.
8. CONCLUSIONS
We have performed a analysis of modern technologies
relevant to the development of web applications. This in-
cludes an overview of the tools and frameworks for digi-
tizing health records. During the development process, we
encountered and solved various challenges, including front-
end issues related to design and user interface, as well as
back-end issues related to application architecture and inte-
gration between front-end and back-end components.
A thorough review of the paper forms was conducted,
focusing on the details and intricacies of the information
fields. After this analysis, we started designing and proto-
typing the web application so that its architecture and func-
tionalities meet the required standards. This phase also in-
cluded rigorous testing of the application’s functions.
Subsequently, we developed an efficient system for
storing information from medical records. Finally, using
the React.js and Express.js frameworks, we successfully
created a web application dedicated to digitizing medical
records. The application uses the MongoDB database for
safe and efficient data storage. This paper highlights the
advancements in web application development and enables
the provision of a functional and user-friendly digital solu-
tion for health record management."

IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this article, we have provided a brief overview of dif-
ferent commercially available Edge AI accelerators. We see a huge variety of devices based on different chips, running
different operating systems, and utilizing different AI frame-
works/runtimes. While manufacturers of all of the devices
mentioned above were able to specify the theoretical max
performance of the devices, usually, they were not able to
specify the power draw of the SBC. It is hard to make even an
educated guess on which edge devices should be used for the
specific deployment in such an environment. It is even harder
when we consider framework-specific optimizations. Another
question is the devices’ limits, for example: Are all the devices
able to run 3D convolutional networks? If not, is it due to the
intrinsic limitations of the chip design or due to the lack of
computing power? We do not know the answer to any of those
questions now.
We believe that there is a need to examine these devices
further and preferably create some kind of guidelines on
how, when, and where to deploy AI applications to achieve
maximum efficiency and low costs. In the process, it is
also necessary to introduce a more objective and less naive
division than only boards/sticks as the board category is still
vast. In order to do so, it is needed to compare them and
preferably create some curated benchmark that would be able
to encompass a significant portion of such devices. This,

This article explores the impact and benefits of digitizing health records, focusing on the care of patients lying at home in the UK.
Although electronic health records (EHRs) have existed for some time, their widespread adoption has escalated in the last decade,
revolutionizing patient care. Digitization of health records increases accessibility, improves communication between healthcare pro-
fessionals, and offers better monitoring and transparency in patient care. Through a case study of implementing a digital solution for
patients and doctors, this article aims to show how such technological advances can significantly improve patient care, reduce costs,
and provide peace of mind for patients’ families.
8. CONCLUSIONS
We have performed a analysis of modern technologies
relevant to the development of web applications. This in-
cludes an overview of the tools and frameworks for digi-
tizing health records. During the development process, we
encountered and solved various challenges, including front-
end issues related to design and user interface, as well as
back-end issues related to application architecture and inte-
gration between front-end and back-end components.
A thorough review of the paper forms was conducted,
focusing on the details and intricacies of the information
fields. After this analysis, we started designing and proto-
typing the web application so that its architecture and func-
tionalities meet the required standards. This phase also in-
cluded rigorous testing of the application’s functions.
Subsequently, we developed an efficient system for
storing information from medical records. Finally, using
the React.js and Express.js frameworks, we successfully
created a web application dedicated to digitizing medical
records. The application uses the MongoDB database for
safe and efficient data storage. This paper highlights the
advancements in web application development and enables
the provision of a functional and user-friendly digital solu-
tion for health record management."

IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this article, we have provided a brief overview of dif-
ferent commercially available Edge AI accelerators. We see a huge variety of devices based on different chips, running
different operating systems, and utilizing different AI frame-
works/runtimes. While manufacturers of all of the devices
mentioned above were able to specify the theoretical max
performance of the devices, usually, they were not able to
specify the power draw of the SBC. It is hard to make even an
educated guess on which edge devices should be used for the
specific deployment in such an environment. It is even harder
when we consider framework-specific optimizations. Another
question is the devices’ limits, for example: Are all the devices
able to run 3D convolutional networks? If not, is it due to the
intrinsic limitations of the chip design or due to the lack of
computing power? We do not know the answer to any of those
questions now.
We believe that there is a need to examine these devices
further and preferably create some kind of guidelines on
how, when, and where to deploy AI applications to achieve
maximum efficiency and low costs. In the process, it is
also necessary to introduce a more objective and less naive
division than only boards/sticks as the board category is still
vast. In order to do so, it is needed to compare them and
preferably create some curated benchmark that would be able
to encompass a significant portion of such devices. This,
however, will mean incorporating a wide variety of different
frameworks and runtimes."

New technologies bring opportunities to deploy AI and machine learning to the edge of
the network, allowing edge devices to train simple models that can then be deployed in practice.
Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique to create a global model by
learning from multiple decentralized edge clients. Although FL methods offer several advantages,
including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of
computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. Internet of Things (IoT) devices
may have limited computing resources, poorer connection quality, or may use different operating
systems. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices
with limited computational resources. This paper also presents FL frameworks that are currently
popular and that provide communication between clients and servers. In this context, various topics
are described, which include contributions and trends in the literature. This includes basic models
and designs of system architecture, possibilities of application in practice, privacy and security, and
resource management. Challenges related to the computational requirements of edge devices such as
hardware heterogeneity, communication overload or limited resources of devices are discussed.

8. Conclusions
Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa-
tional power of the devices on the edge of the network and the large and diverse datasets
to train machine learning models without compromising data privacy. Privacy is key for
applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing
these data are often impossible. Before these architectures are widely used in commonplace
applications, many research questions still need to be resolved, despite a few examples of
FL being successfully used in production settings. FL has become a cutting-edge paradigm
in response to the growing computational power of devices such as smartphones, wear-
ables, and autonomous cars, as well as worries about the security of sensitive data. Due
to the increased need for local data storage and the relocation of ML computations to end
devices while minimizing data transfer overhead, researchers have tried to implement FL
architectures in various domains. An overview of the FL paradigm, which is gaining popu-
larity, is provided in this article. We focused on the most recent materials and publications,

IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this article, we have provided a brief overview of dif-
ferent commercially available Edge AI accelerators. We see a huge variety of devices based on different chips, running
different operating systems, and utilizing different AI frame-
works/runtimes. While manufacturers of all of the devices
mentioned above were able to specify the theoretical max
performance of the devices, usually, they were not able to
specify the power draw of the SBC. It is hard to make even an
educated guess on which edge devices should be used for the
specific deployment in such an environment. It is even harder
when we consider framework-specific optimizations. Another
question is the devices’ limits, for example: Are all the devices
able to run 3D convolutional networks? If not, is it due to the
intrinsic limitations of the chip design or due to the lack of
computing power? We do not know the answer to any of those
questions now.
We believe that there is a need to examine these devices
further and preferably create some kind of guidelines on
how, when, and where to deploy AI applications to achieve
maximum efficiency and low costs. In the process, it is
also necessary to introduce a more objective and less naive
division than only boards/sticks as the board category is still
vast. In order to do so, it is needed to compare them and
preferably create some curated benchmark that would be able
to encompass a significant portion of such devices. This,
however, will mean incorporating a wide variety of different
frameworks and runtimes."

New technologies bring opportunities to deploy AI and machine learning to the edge of
the network, allowing edge devices to train simple models that can then be deployed in practice.
Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique to create a global model by
learning from multiple decentralized edge clients. Although FL methods offer several advantages,
including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of
computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. Internet of Things (IoT) devices
may have limited computing resources, poorer connection quality, or may use different operating
systems. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices
with limited computational resources. This paper also presents FL frameworks that are currently
popular and that provide communication between clients and servers. In this context, various topics
are described, which include contributions and trends in the literature. This includes basic models
and designs of system architecture, possibilities of application in practice, privacy and security, and
resource management. Challenges related to the computational requirements of edge devices such as
hardware heterogeneity, communication overload or limited resources of devices are discussed.

8. Conclusions
Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa-
tional power of the devices on the edge of the network and the large and diverse datasets
to train machine learning models without compromising data privacy. Privacy is key for
applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing
these data are often impossible. Before these architectures are widely used in commonplace
applications, many research questions still need to be resolved, despite a few examples of
FL being successfully used in production settings. FL has become a cutting-edge paradigm
in response to the growing computational power of devices such as smartphones, wear-
ables, and autonomous cars, as well as worries about the security of sensitive data. Due
to the increased need for local data storage and the relocation of ML computations to end
devices while minimizing data transfer overhead, researchers have tried to implement FL
architectures in various domains. An overview of the FL paradigm, which is gaining popu-
larity, is provided in this article. We focused on the most recent materials and publications,
as we discussed FL’s fundamental architecture, communication, design, and analysis. We
discussed the basic requirements that FL must meet, the difﬁculties involved, the potential

for deployment and use in practical applications, and the frameworks with which FL is
compatible. We have focused on the overview of the frameworks and examined the oper-
ating systems they supported and the potential for deployment on various edge devices.
We discussed potential future directions for FL use in diverse IoT environments. We also
considered the problems and difﬁculties that must be solved for edge devices that are
resource-constrained and have limited computational power, even though the hardware
speciﬁcations they employ are not always listed in the literature."

This article explores the impact and benefits of digitizing health records, focusing on the care of patients lying at home in the UK.
Although electronic health records (EHRs) have existed for some time, their widespread adoption has escalated in the last decade,
revolutionizing patient care. Digitization of health records increases accessibility, improves communication between healthcare pro-
fessionals, and offers better monitoring and transparency in patient care. Through a case study of implementing a digital solution for
patients and doctors, this article aims to show how such technological advances can significantly improve patient care, reduce costs,
and provide peace of mind for patients’ families.

New technologies bring opportunities to deploy AI and machine learning to the edge of
the network, allowing edge devices to train simple models that can then be deployed in practice.
Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique to create a global model by
learning from multiple decentralized edge clients. Although FL methods offer several advantages,
including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of
computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. Internet of Things (IoT) devices
may have limited computing resources, poorer connection quality, or may use different operating
systems. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices
with limited computational resources. This paper also presents FL frameworks that are currently
popular and that provide communication between clients and servers. In this context, various topics
are described, which include contributions and trends in the literature. This includes basic models
and designs of system architecture, possibilities of application in practice, privacy and security, and
resource management. Challenges related to the computational requirements of edge devices such as
hardware heterogeneity, communication overload or limited resources of devices are discussed.

8. Conclusions
Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa-
tional power of the devices on the edge of the network and the large and diverse datasets
to train machine learning models without compromising data privacy. Privacy is key for
applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing
these data are often impossible. Before these architectures are widely used in commonplace
applications, many research questions still need to be resolved, despite a few examples of
FL being successfully used in production settings. FL has become a cutting-edge paradigm
in response to the growing computational power of devices such as smartphones, wear-
ables, and autonomous cars, as well as worries about the security of sensitive data. Due
to the increased need for local data storage and the relocation of ML computations to end
devices while minimizing data transfer overhead, researchers have tried to implement FL
architectures in various domains. An overview of the FL paradigm, which is gaining popu-
larity, is provided in this article. We focused on the most recent materials and publications,
as we discussed FL’s fundamental architecture, communication, design, and analysis. We
discussed the basic requirements that FL must meet, the difﬁculties involved, the potential

for deployment and use in practical applications, and the frameworks with which FL is
compatible. We have focused on the overview of the frameworks and examined the oper-
ating systems they supported and the potential for deployment on various edge devices.
We discussed potential future directions for FL use in diverse IoT environments. We also
considered the problems and difﬁculties that must be solved for edge devices that are
resource-constrained and have limited computational power, even though the hardware
speciﬁcations they employ are not always listed in the literature."

This article explores the impact and benefits of digitizing health records, focusing on the care of patients lying at home in the UK.
Although electronic health records (EHRs) have existed for some time, their widespread adoption has escalated in the last decade,
revolutionizing patient care. Digitization of health records increases accessibility, improves communication between healthcare pro-
fessionals, and offers better monitoring and transparency in patient care. Through a case study of implementing a digital solution for
patients and doctors, this article aims to show how such technological advances can significantly improve patient care, reduce costs,
and provide peace of mind for patients’ families.
8. CONCLUSIONS
We have performed a analysis of modern technologies
relevant to the development of web applications. This in-
cludes an overview of the tools and frameworks for digi-
tizing health records. During the development process, we
encountered and solved various challenges, including front-
end issues related to design and user interface, as well as
back-end issues related to application architecture and inte-
gration between front-end and back-end components.
A thorough review of the paper forms was conducted,
focusing on the details and intricacies of the information
fields. After this analysis, we started designing and proto-
typing the web application so that its architecture and func-
tionalities meet the required standards. This phase also in-
cluded rigorous testing of the application’s functions.
Subsequently, we developed an efficient system for
storing information from medical records. Finally, using
the React.js and Express.js frameworks, we successfully
created a web application dedicated to digitizing medical
records. The application uses the MongoDB database for
safe and efficient data storage. This paper highlights the
advancements in web application development and enables
the provision of a functional and user-friendly digital solu-
tion for health record management."

In this article, we have provided a brief overview of dif-

different operating systems, and utilizing different AI frame-

specify the power draw of the SBC. It is hard to make even an
educated guess on which edge devices should be used for the
specific deployment in such an environment. It is even harder
when we consider framework-specific optimizations. Another
question is the devices’ limits, for example: Are all the devices
able to run 3D convolutional networks? If not, is it due to the
intrinsic limitations of the chip design or due to the lack of
computing power? We do not know the answer to any of those
questions now.

resource-constrained and have limited computational power, even though the hardware

This article explores the impact and benefits of digitizing health records, focusing on the care of patients lying at home in the UK.
Although electronic health records (EHRs) have existed for some time, their widespread adoption has escalated in the last decade,
revolutionizing patient care. Digitization of health records increases accessibility, improves communication between healthcare pro-
fessionals, and offers better monitoring and transparency in patient care. Through a case study of implementing a digital solution for
patients and doctors, this article aims to show how such technological advances can significantly improve patient care, reduce costs,
and provide peace of mind for patients’ families.
8. CONCLUSIONS
We have performed a analysis of modern technologies
relevant to the development of web applications. This in-
cludes an overview of the tools and frameworks for digi-
tizing health records. During the development process, we
encountered and solved various challenges, including front-
end issues related to design and user interface, as well as
back-end issues related to application architecture and inte-
gration between front-end and back-end components.
A thorough review of the paper forms was conducted,
focusing on the details and intricacies of the information
fields. After this analysis, we started designing and proto-
typing the web application so that its architecture and func-
tionalities meet the required standards. This phase also in-
cluded rigorous testing of the application’s functions.
Subsequently, we developed an efficient system for
storing information from medical records. Finally, using
the React.js and Express.js frameworks, we successfully
created a web application dedicated to digitizing medical
records. The application uses the MongoDB database for
safe and efficient data storage. This paper highlights the
advancements in web application development and enables
the provision of a functional and user-friendly digital solu-
tion for health record management."

IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this article, we have provided a brief overview of dif-
ferent commercially available Edge AI accelerators. We see a huge variety of devices based on different chips, running
different operating systems, and utilizing different AI frame-
works/runtimes. While manufacturers of all of the devices
mentioned above were able to specify the theoretical max
performance of the devices, usually, they were not able to
specify the power draw of the SBC. It is hard to make even an
educated guess on which edge devices should be used for the
specific deployment in such an environment. It is even harder
when we consider framework-specific optimizations. Another
question is the devices’ limits, for example: Are all the devices
able to run 3D convolutional networks? If not, is it due to the
intrinsic limitations of the chip design or due to the lack of
computing power? We do not know the answer to any of those
questions now.
We believe that there is a need to examine these devices
further and preferably create some kind of guidelines on
how, when, and where to deploy AI applications to achieve
maximum efficiency and low costs. In the process, it is
also necessary to introduce a more objective and less naive
division than only boards/sticks as the board category is still
vast. In order to do so, it is needed to compare them and
preferably create some curated benchmark that would be able
to encompass a significant portion of such devices. This,
however, will mean incorporating a wide variety of different
frameworks and runtimes."

New technologies bring opportunities to deploy AI and machine learning to the edge of
the network, allowing edge devices to train simple models that can then be deployed in practice.
Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique to create a global model by
learning from multiple decentralized edge clients. Although FL methods offer several advantages,
including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of
computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. Internet of Things (IoT) devices
may have limited computing resources, poorer connection quality, or may use different operating
systems. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices
with limited computational resources. This paper also presents FL frameworks that are currently
popular and that provide communication between clients and servers. In this context, various topics
are described, which include contributions and trends in the literature. This includes basic models
and designs of system architecture, possibilities of application in practice, privacy and security, and
resource management. Challenges related to the computational requirements of edge devices such as
hardware heterogeneity, communication overload or limited resources of devices are discussed.

8. Conclusions
Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa-
tional power of the devices on the edge of the network and the large and diverse datasets
to train machine learning models without compromising data privacy. Privacy is key for
applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing

fessionals, and offers better monitoring and transparency in patient care. Through a case study of implementing a digital solution for
patients and doctors, this article aims to show how such technological advances can significantly improve patient care, reduce costs,
and provide peace of mind for patients’ families.

boom in the field of AI, and particularly in a subset called
deep learning. The models used in deep learning are often
relatively computationally expensive and problematic to execute
in real-time in environments with computational and energetic
constraints. In order to do so, specialized hardware, so-called
AI Accelerators are often utilized. The term AI Accelerators
encompass a wide variety of different devices using different
technologies. This work surveys a market and introduces an
overview of such accelerators for a network’s edge constrained
by electrical energy.
IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this article, we have provided a brief overview of dif-
ferent commercially available Edge AI accelerators. We see a huge variety of devices based on different chips, running
different operating systems, and utilizing different AI frame-
works/runtimes. While manufacturers of all of the devices
mentioned above were able to specify the theoretical max
performance of the devices, usually, they were not able to
specify the power draw of the SBC. It is hard to make even an
educated guess on which edge devices should be used for the
specific deployment in such an environment. It is even harder
when we consider framework-specific optimizations. Another
question is the devices’ limits, for example: Are all the devices
able to run 3D convolutional networks? If not, is it due to the
intrinsic limitations of the chip design or due to the lack of
computing power? We do not know the answer to any of those
questions now.
We believe that there is a need to examine these devices
further and preferably create some kind of guidelines on
how, when, and where to deploy AI applications to achieve
maximum efficiency and low costs. In the process, it is
also necessary to introduce a more objective and less naive
division than only boards/sticks as the board category is still
vast. In order to do so, it is needed to compare them and
preferably create some curated benchmark that would be able
to encompass a significant portion of such devices. This,
however, will mean incorporating a wide variety of different
frameworks and runtimes."

New technologies bring opportunities to deploy AI and machine learning to the edge of
the network, allowing edge devices to train simple models that can then be deployed in practice.
Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique to create a global model by
learning from multiple decentralized edge clients. Although FL methods offer several advantages,
including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of
computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. Internet of Things (IoT) devices
may have limited computing resources, poorer connection quality, or may use different operating
systems. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices
with limited computational resources. This paper also presents FL frameworks that are currently
popular and that provide communication between clients and servers. In this context, various topics
are described, which include contributions and trends in the literature. This includes basic models
and designs of system architecture, possibilities of application in practice, privacy and security, and
resource management. Challenges related to the computational requirements of edge devices such as
hardware heterogeneity, communication overload or limited resources of devices are discussed.

8. Conclusions
Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa-
tional power of the devices on the edge of the network and the large and diverse datasets
to train machine learning models without compromising data privacy. Privacy is key for
applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing
these data are often impossible. Before these architectures are widely used in commonplace
applications, many research questions still need to be resolved, despite a few examples of
FL being successfully used in production settings. FL has become a cutting-edge paradigm
in response to the growing computational power of devices such as smartphones, wear-
ables, and autonomous cars, as well as worries about the security of sensitive data. Due
to the increased need for local data storage and the relocation of ML computations to end
devices while minimizing data transfer overhead, researchers have tried to implement FL
architectures in various domains. An overview of the FL paradigm, which is gaining popu-
larity, is provided in this article. We focused on the most recent materials and publications,
as we discussed FL’s fundamental architecture, communication, design, and analysis. We
discussed the basic requirements that FL must meet, the difﬁculties involved, the potential

for deployment and use in practical applications, and the frameworks with which FL is
compatible. We have focused on the overview of the frameworks and examined the oper-
ating systems they supported and the potential for deployment on various edge devices.
We discussed potential future directions for FL use in diverse IoT environments. We also
considered the problems and difﬁculties that must be solved for edge devices that are
resource-constrained and have limited computational power, even though the hardware
speciﬁcations they employ are not always listed in the literature."
