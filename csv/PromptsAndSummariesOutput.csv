Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices.

They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created.

Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network.

Digitization increases accessibility, improves communication between healthcare pro- fessionals, and offers better monitoring and transparency in patient care. Health record digitization applications are software tools that enable the digitization and storage of patient health records. Some apps also enable doctor-patient commu- nication, online appointment scheduling and management, and real-time tracking of health data and outcomes. These apps improve patient care treatment efficiency and increase patient satisfaction. The objective of this paper is to design and implement a web-based application that facilitates doctors in maintain- ing and accessing patient records. This digital platform aims to streamline the process of updating individual pa- tient profiles with pertinent health information. The paper will describe the development of both fron- tend and backend technologies. System architecture delineates specific roles for its users, with a particular emphasis on two pri- mary roles: patients and doctors. For patients, the system grants exclusive access to their individual health records. Doctor or caregiver possess the capability to access the records of all pa- tients under their care, including those they have personally added or managed. A paper version of this form is shown in Fig. 3. The pediatric tracheostomy safety checklist is a form that contains a list of measures that the caregiver must check and record on the form. The body map form is a special tool used by healthcare professionals to record important information about a pa- tient’s health. The web app is designed to be simple, clear and intuitive, with an emphasis on usability and accessibility.

In the paper version of the form, the list was divided into seven working days and each day was further divided into day and night shifts. A chronologi- cal record was chosen, where the date and day of the week are added to each record. This approach has made it easier and faster to complete the form without having to manually split the records into days and shifts. The application was developed locally and deployed on the MS Azure cloud platform for testing purposes. a scenario designed to test the editing of the caregiver profile. Our final test scenario is shown in Table 3 and aims totest the possibility of displaying the data to patients.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

**Federated Learning: Opportunities and Challenges**

As we continue to rely on edge devices for computing power, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach to utilize this computational power while ensuring privacy. However, FL also presents specific issues that require attention.

Firstly, the training data of each client in FL depends heavily on the use of local devices, leading to varying data distributions across clients. This necessitates careful scheduling techniques, particularly when dealing with IoT devices with constrained computational power.

Furthermore, FL requires scalability to accommodate a large number of participating clients and devices. As we move towards 5G and 6G networks, communication between devices will become even more critical.

It is essential to address the challenges associated with sharing private data, as this can compromise network privacy and security. In applications such as healthcare or finance, where sensitive data is involved, FL must prioritize privacy.

In my opinion, Federated Learning has tremendous potential for smart cities, edge computing, and IoT devices. However, we must also acknowledge the challenges and open issues that require further research and development.

In this discourse, I delve into the significant implications and advantages of digitizing health records, with a particular focus on home care patients in the United Kingdom. The digitalization process enhances accessibility, improves communication among healthcare professionals, and provides better monitoring and transparency in patient care.

The heart of this transformation lies in health record digitization applications—software tools designed for the digitization and storage of patient health records. These applications also facilitate doctor-patient communication, online appointment scheduling, management, and real-time tracking of health data and outcomes. Such digital innovations contribute to improved patient care efficiency, treatment efficacy, and overall satisfaction.

My current academic endeavor revolves around the design and implementation of a web-based application tailored for doctors to maintain and access patient records seamlessly. This digital platform is designed to streamline the process of updating individual patient profiles with pertinent health information.

The system architecture outlines specific roles for its users, primarily emphasizing two key roles: patients and doctors. Patients are granted exclusive access to their individual health records, while doctors or caregivers can access the records of all patients under their care, including those they have personally added or managed.

One essential feature of this application is the Pediatric Tracheostomy Safety Checklist and Body Map forms, which healthcare professionals utilize to record critical patient information. The web app prioritizes simplicity, clarity, usability, and accessibility. Upon registration, users simply fill out a straightforward form with their username, email address, and password.

The dashboard window contains a pair of graphs that provide essential information about the vital functions of the patient’s body. The Pediatric Tracheostomy Safety Checklist protocol is a list of steps that the caregiver must check and record on the form, with each day divided into seven working days and further subdivided into day and night shifts. A chronological record was chosen for this application to facilitate easy and swift completion without manual intervention.

The application was developed locally and deployed on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform for testing purposes. I designed a scenario to test the editing of the caregiver profile, and our final test scenario aims to display data to patients. The application garnered positive feedback from users, with no reservations regarding its design or functionality.

In conclusion, we have successfully developed an efficient system for storing medical record information, ultimately resulting in a web application dedicated to digitizing records. The application leverages the React.js and Express.js frameworks and employs the MongoDB database for safe and efficient data storage. This study underscores advancements in web application development and paves the way for providing a functional and user-friendly digital solution for health record management.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Meanwhile, Bearkey has been collaborating with Linaro and 96Boards since 2019, utilizing Rockchip chips. The Google Coral family is built around the Edge Tensor Processing Unit (Edge TPU), also used by another Chinese manufacturer that partnered with 96Boards.

Other notable players include Bitmain Sophon Edge Developer Board, powered by Sophon BM1880 ASIC, and Intel Neural Compute Stick 2, which leverages Intel Movidius Myriad X Vision Processing Unit. The Orange PI AI Stick Lite features a Lightspeeur SPR2801S neural accelerator, while the Rockchip RK1808 AI Compute stick boasts a standalone NPU from the RK3399Pro chip.

While these devices showcase impressive theoretical maximum performances, power draw specifications are often lacking. I firmly believe that it's essential to explore these devices further and establish guidelines for deploying AI applications efficiently and cost-effectively.

Note: I've written the post from a first-person singular perspective, using a formal tone and B2 English. The hashtags are targeted at a university audience."," In the realm of Edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) accelerators for energy-constrained edge computing, I recently came across an insightful study by Ladislav Pomś, Alexander Brecko, and Iveta Zolotov´a from the Department of Cybernetics and Artificial Intelligence at Technical University of Košice, Slovakia.

The study provides a comprehensive overview of various AI Accelerators utilizing diverse technologies, with power consumption up to 40W TDP. Notably absent are devices directly tied to specific devices such as cameras. Some accelerators are available in multiple form factors and will be included in both sections. As some boards/sticks do not have official power draw numbers, the authors calculated these using the maximal possible power draw.

The Huawei Atlas family includes 200, 300, 500, 800, and 900 series with different purposes and aims. On the other hand, Bearkey has been using Rockchip chips and collaborating with Linaro and 96Boards since at least 2019. Google Coral family shares a common Edge Tensor Processing Unit (Edge TPU) with another Chinese manufacturer that collaborated with 96Boards as well. Their platform currently features only a single SBC, module, and stick.

The SBC is called Bitmain Sophon Edge Developer Board (BSEDB) [22] and is powered by Sophon BM1880 ASIC, capable of providing up to 1 TOPS or 2 TOPS with Winograd acceleration. The platform supports inference for TensorFlow, Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX), PyTorch, and Caffe models.

The Intel Neural Compute Stick 2 (INCS2) employs the Intel Movidius Myriad X Vision Processing Unit with 16 SHAVE cores and 4GB of RAM for deep neural network inference acceleration. Google Coral USB Accelerator utilizes the same Edge TPU as its family, while Orange PI AI Stick Lite (OPAI) is equipped with a Lightspeeur SPR2801S neural accelerator. Lastly, the Rockchip RK1808 AI Compute stick features a standalone NPU from the RK3399Pro chip.

The theoretical maximum performance of these devices varies significantly. However, their power consumption details are often not specified, which highlights the need for further examination and the creation of guidelines on when, where, and how to deploy AI applications to maximize efficiency and minimize costs.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

The rise of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to an increase in computationally intensive tasks and applications. Federated learning (FL), a promising approach for utilizing edge computing power, faces specific challenges in IoT environments.

One key issue is the diverse data distribution among connected clients, which can lead to differing training times due to varying memory sizes and availability. Scheduling techniques must be carefully designed to accommodate these differences, particularly when working with computationally constrained devices.

Scalability is another crucial aspect of FL systems, as many clients participate in model training. Future research directions include improving communication between devices, increasing data transfer, and enhancing coverage, potentially leveraging 5G and 6G networks.

Privacy concerns also play a significant role in FL, especially in applications like healthcare and finance where data sharing is often impossible. Effective solutions must balance privacy preservation with the need for efficient data processing.

Despite these challenges, FL offers immense potential for digital twins in smart cities, edge computing, and various other applications. As this field continues to evolve, it's essential to address the complexities and limitations of FL in IoT environments."," The field of Federated Learning (FL) is gaining popularity due to its potential in utilizing the computational power of devices on the edge of networks. This approach is particularly useful for sensitive applications such as healthcare and finance, where data sharing is often impossible. However, scalability is a key challenge in FL systems, especially in an Internet of Things (IoT) environment with numerous participating clients.

Future research in this area could focus on improving communication between devices, increasing data transfer rates, and expanding coverage. With the advent of 5G and future 6G networks, edge devices may leverage these advanced communication technologies for more efficient FL.

The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) are becoming increasingly influential in setting global standards for data privacy and protection.

Recent advancements in FL include Federated Learning for smart cities, on-device Federated Learning, federated learning for anomaly detection, credit risk assessment, attack detection, collaborative manufacturing, autonomous vehicles, and more. These developments are pushing the boundaries of what is possible with FL, particularly in edge computing and AI of Things.

Researchers are also working on overcoming challenges such as communication overhead, non-IID data distribution, and asynchronous learning for geospatial applications. The goal is to create a scalable, low-latency, and efficient Federated Learning system that can handle large numbers of participating devices.

In summary, Federated Learning is an exciting area of research with significant potential for the future. It offers the promise of utilizing the computational power of edge devices while preserving privacy, making it ideal for sensitive applications. With ongoing advancements and the continued development of privacy-preserving techniques, we can expect to see more innovative applications of Federated Learning in various industries."

They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network.

Digitization increases accessibility, improves communication between healthcare pro- fessionals, and offers better monitoring and transparency in patient care. Health record digitization applications are software tools that enable the digitization and storage of patient health records. Some apps also enable doctor-patient commu- nication, online appointment scheduling and management, and real-time tracking of health data and outcomes. These apps improve patient care treatment efficiency and increase patient satisfaction. The objective of this paper is to design and implement a web-based application that facilitates doctors in maintain- ing and accessing patient records. This digital platform aims to streamline the process of updating individual pa- tient profiles with pertinent health information. The paper will describe the development of both fron- tend and backend technologies. System architecture delineates specific roles for its users, with a particular emphasis on two pri- mary roles: patients and doctors. For patients, the system grants exclusive access to their individual health records. Doctor or caregiver possess the capability to access the records of all pa- tients under their care, including those they have personally added or managed. A paper version of this form is shown in Fig. 3. The pediatric tracheostomy safety checklist is a form that contains a list of measures that the caregiver must check and record on the form. The body map form is a special tool used by healthcare professionals to record important information about a pa- tient’s health. The web app is designed to be simple, clear and intuitive, with an emphasis on usability and accessibility. When registering, the user registers us- ing a simple form, where he must fill in a username, email address and password. The dashboard window contains a pair of graphs that provide information about the vital functions of the patient’s body. Paediatric tracheostomy safety checklist protocol is a list of steps that the caregiver must check and record on the form. In the paper version of the form, the list was divided into seven working days and each day was further divided into day and night shifts. A chronologi- cal record was chosen, where the date and day of the week are added to each record. This approach has made it easier and faster to complete the form without having to manually split the records into days and shifts. The application was developed locally and deployed on the MS Azure cloud platform for testing purposes. a scenario designed to test the editing of the caregiver profile. Our final test scenario is shown in Table 3 and aims totest the possibility of displaying the data to patients. The application was generally positively evaluated, and users had no reserva- tions about the design and functionality. The graph high- lights that the application was stable and operated effectively. we developed an efficient system for storing information from medical records. Finally, using the React.js and Express.js frameworks, we successfully created a web application dedicated to digitizing records. The application uses the MongoDB database for safe and efficient data storage.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

""Federated Learning: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of Edge Computing

As we dive deeper into the world of edge computing, federated learning has emerged as a promising approach to harnessing the computational power of devices on the edge. But let's be real, it's not all sunshine and rainbows.

In this post, we'll summarize the key challenges and opportunities in federated learning for IoT applications. From scheduling techniques to data distribution issues, we'll cover it all.

So, what are the main takeaways?

* Scheduling is a crucial aspect of FL, especially when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power.
* Data distribution can be quite different from one client to another, making it challenging to develop scalable and efficient learning models.
* Privacy is key in FL applications, particularly in sensitive industries like healthcare and finance.

If you're an engineer looking for a comprehensive overview of the federated learning paradigm, this post is for you. We'll also explore some recent advances and future directions in the field.

So, grab your favorite coffee (or tea), sit back, and let's dive into the world of federated learning!""

Note: I've written the post from a first-person plural perspective (""we"" instead of ""I"") as requested.","Here's a LinkedIn post summarizing the text in a humorous tone:

""As engineers, we've all been there - stuck trying to optimize our distributed optimization problems, only to realize that federated learning is a whole different beast. I mean, who wouldn't want to train models on their own devices, with their own data, and then somehow magically make it all work together? Sounds like a party, right?

But seriously, FL has some unique challenges. For one, our IoT devices are not exactly supercomputers, so we need to be careful when scheduling tasks. And don't even get me started on the data distribution - it's like trying to herd cats. Each client has its own special snowflake dataset, and getting them all to work together is no easy feat.

And then there's the issue of privacy. We're not just talking about any old data here, folks. We're talking about healthcare records, financial info... the works. So we need to make sure that our FL systems are secure, private, and scalable (because let's face it, those IoT devices are multiplying faster than rabbits).

But despite all these challenges, FL is still an incredibly promising approach. I mean, who wouldn't want to harness the power of edge computing, 5G networks, and digital twins to create smart cities that actually work? It's like something out of a sci-fi novel.

So what's next for us engineers? Well, we need to keep working on those scheduling techniques, improving communication between devices, and figuring out how to make FL systems more efficient. And maybe, just maybe, we'll get to a world where every good question is answered (thanks, Ian Goodfellow).

Until then, let's keep pushing the boundaries of what's possible with federated learning."""," In the rapidly evolving world of edge computing and Internet of Things (IoT), Federated Learning (FL) is gaining significant traction due to its potential in leveraging the growing computational power of devices on the network's edge. This paradigm, particularly relevant for sensitive applications such as healthcare and finance, addresses critical privacy concerns by keeping data local while still enabling effective machine learning models.

As we delve deeper into FL research, scalability remains a primary focus, considering the vast number of IoT clients participating in model training. Enhancing communication between devices, improving data transfer efficiency, and expanding network coverage are key areas for future work. The advent of 5G and 6G networks could potentially revolutionize communication for edge devices.

However, sharing private data within this framework carries inherent risks, such as data leakage and privacy breaches. To tackle these challenges, we need to devise strategies that cater to the varying training times due to memory sizes and availability, ensuring a consistent number of data samples across participants.

The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) are setting global standards for data privacy and protection. As FL gains popularity, it is essential to align with these regulations to maintain trust and security.

Recent studies have explored various aspects of FL, from its application in smart cities and healthcare informatics to anomaly detection and autonomous vehicles. Innovative approaches like asynchronous federated learning for geospatial applications and selective model aggregation in vehicular edge computing are paving the way for scalable, low-latency FL systems.

As engineers, it is our responsibility to navigate this exciting yet complex landscape, staying abreast of the latest developments while upholding privacy and security standards. By collaborating and sharing knowledge, we can foster innovation and unlock the full potential of Federated Learning for a smarter, more connected world.

Onwards, as we continue our journey into the realms of edge computing, IoT, and FL, let us remember to maintain a sense of humor in the face of complex challenges and keep pushing the boundaries of what's possible!"

We've been developing a web-based application, a digital oasis in the desert of paper records. This platform will streamline the process of updating individual profiles with all things health-related. It's designed to be as intuitive as our morning coffee and as user-friendly as your favorite coding language (we hope).

We've got a nifty pediatric tracheostomy safety checklist, a body map form, and a dashboard window that gives you a peek into the vital functions of your patient's body. The best part? No more manually splitting records into days and shifts. We've made it chronological, making it easier and faster to complete forms, like magic!

We've deployed our app on the MS Azure cloud platform for testing purposes. We've even designed a scenario to test the editing of the caregiver profile. And guess what? Users loved it! They found it stable, effective, and easy to use – just the way we like our code!

So, grab your coffee (or tea if that's more your style), sit back, and join us as we continue to push the boundaries of web application development in health record management. After all, who said making a difference had to be boring?

Alexander Brecko, PhD student at DCAI FEEI TUKE, and our very own digital health pioneer, Iveta Zolotov´a, are leading the charge. They're working on deploying AI models to the Edge, especially in the area of Parkinson disease diagnostics. Stay tuned for more adventures in the world of digital health!"

""Hey fellow engineers! We're diving into the world of Edge AI accelerators and exploring the devices that power energy-constrained edge computing. From Huawei Atlas to Orange PI AI Stick Lite, we've got a rundown of the top players in this space.

We're talking about devices with up to 40W TDP, excluding those directly tied to a single device like cameras. Some of these accelerators come in both board and stick form factors, while others have been calculating their power draw using maximal possible power draw.

Let's take a look at some of the key players:

* Huawei Atlas family: featuring devices with different purposes and aims, from 200 to 900 series.
* Bearkey: using Rockchip chips and collaborating with Linaro and 96Boards since at least 2019.
* Google Coral family: based on Edge Tensor Processing Unit (Edge TPU) and featuring a single SBC, module, and stick.

That's our take on Edge AI accelerators for energy-constrained edge computing. What do you think? Have any questions or insights to share?""","Here's a LinkedIn post summarizing the text:

""As engineers, we're always on the lookout for ways to optimize our AI applications and squeeze every last bit of performance out of our devices. That's why we've been digging into the world of Edge AI accelerators - those clever little devices that help us process data faster and more efficiently at the edge.

We've been taking a closer look at some of the top players in this space, from Huawei's Atlas family to Google's Coral family, and even Bearkey's Rockchip-powered boards. And let me tell you, it's impressive stuff. Theoretical max performances range from 1 TOPS all the way up to 16 SHAVE cores and 4GB of RAM - that's some serious processing power.

We've been diving deep into the world of Edge AI accelerators lately, and let me tell you, it's a wild ride! From Huawei's Atlas family to Bearkey, Google Coral, Intel, Orange Pi, Rockchip, and even Nvidia, there's no shortage of powerful devices using different technologies out there.

Now, these accelerators come in all shapes and sizes, with some drawing up to 40W TDP (that's a lot of juice!). We've excluded any single-purpose devices like cameras from our exploration, but that doesn't mean we haven't missed out on anything fun!

Huawei's Atlas family includes the 200, 300, 500, 800, and 900 series. Each one serves a different purpose with its unique capabilities. Bearkey, on the other hand, has been teaming up with Linaro and 96Boards since 2019, using Rockchip chips to power their AI wonders.

The Google Coral family is another fascinating player in the field. Based on the same Edge Tensor Processing Unit (Edge TPU), they've collaborated with 96Boards, and while their platform currently only offers a single SBC, module, and stick, there's more to come!

One intriguing device is the Bitmain Sophon Edge Developer Board (BSEDB) [22]. Powered by Sophon BM1880 ASIC, this baby can provide up to 1 TOPS or even 2 TOPS with Winograd acceleration. The platform supports inference for TF, ONNX, PT, and Caffe models – impressive stuff!

The Intel Neural Compute Stick 2 (INCS2) is another standout performer. Utilizing the Intel Movidius Myriad X Vision Processing Unit with 16 SHAVE cores and 4GB of RAM, it's a powerhouse for deep neural network inference.

The Google Coral USB Accelerator also boasts the same Edge TPU found in the Coral family, while the Orange Pi AI Stick Lite features a Lightspeeur SPR2801S neural accelerator. Lastly, the Rockchip RK1808 AI Compute stick sports a standalone NPU from the RK3399Pro chip.

The theoretical max performance of these devices is astounding, though we're still working on figuring out their actual power draw (some of those boards are real powerhouses!).

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles.

**Unlocking the Power of Federated Learning: Challenges and Opportunities**

As we continue to push the boundaries of artificial intelligence and machine learning, federated learning has emerged as a promising approach for harnessing the collective power of edge devices. But, let's be honest - this technology is not without its challenges.

With federated learning, each client contributes its own unique data distribution to the model training process. This means that scheduling techniques are crucial to ensure efficient and effective training. Moreover, with IoT devices participating in model training, scalability becomes a critical factor.

But what about privacy concerns? With private data being shared across devices, the risk of data leakage and privacy breaches is real. As we move forward with federated learning, it's essential that we prioritize privacy and develop robust solutions to safeguard sensitive information.

In this rapidly evolving landscape, I'd like to highlight some key research areas:

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized.

Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications.

We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Digitization increases accessibility, improves communication between healthcare pro- fessionals, and offers better monitoring and transparency in patient care. Health record digitization applications are software tools that enable the digitization and storage of patient health records. Some apps also enable doctor-patient commu- nication, online appointment scheduling and management, and real-time tracking of health data and outcomes. These apps improve patient care treatment efficiency and increase patient satisfaction. The objective of this paper is to design and implement a web-based application that facilitates doctors in maintain- ing and accessing patient records. This digital platform aims to streamline the process of updating individual pa- tient profiles with pertinent health information. The paper will describe the development of both fron- tend and backend technologies. System architecture delineates specific roles for its users, with a particular emphasis on two pri- mary roles: patients and doctors. For patients, the system grants exclusive access to their individual health records. Doctor or caregiver possess the capability to access the records of all pa- tients under their care, including those they have personally added or managed. A paper version of this form is shown in Fig. 3. The pediatric tracheostomy safety checklist is a form that contains a list of measures that the caregiver must check and record on the form. The body map form is a special tool used by healthcare professionals to record important information about a pa- tient’s health. The web app is designed to be simple, clear and intuitive, with an emphasis on usability and accessibility. When registering, the user registers us- ing a simple form, where he must fill in a username, email address and password. The dashboard window contains a pair of graphs that provide information about the vital functions of the patient’s body. Paediatric tracheostomy safety checklist protocol is a list of steps that the caregiver must check and record on the form. In the paper version of the form, the list was divided into seven working days and each day was further divided into day and night shifts. A chronologi- cal record was chosen, where the date and day of the week are added to each record. This approach has made it easier and faster to complete the form without having to manually split the records into days and shifts. The application was developed locally and deployed on the MS Azure cloud platform for testing purposes. a scenario designed to test the editing of the caregiver profile. Our final test scenario is shown in Table 3 and aims totest the possibility of displaying the data to patients. The application was generally positively evaluated, and users had no reserva- tions about the design and functionality. The graph high- lights that the application was stable and operated effectively. we developed an efficient system for storing information from medical records. Finally, using the React.js and Express.js frameworks, we successfully created a web application dedicated to digitizing records. The application uses the MongoDB database for safe and efficient data storage.

It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication.

As FL continues to grow, it is essential to ensure compliance with these regulations while maximizing the benefits of this technology.

In the realm of software development, we are actively exploring various aspects of FL, including communication overhead mitigation, knowledge distillation for communication efficiency, handling non-IID data, asynchronous learning for geospatial applications, and more. Our goal is to create scalable, low-latency FL systems that cater to the needs of a wide range of applications, from autonomous vehicles to cyber-physical systems.

In conclusion, Federated Learning offers a promising approach to harnessing the ever-increasing computational power at the edge while addressing privacy concerns. As we continue to explore this technology, it is essential to maintain our focus on scalability, communication efficiency, and privacy preservation to unlock its full potential. 🌐🚀🔒"

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

As we move forward in the world of AI, it's crucial that we create guidelines for deploying these devices effectively. Whether you're a student or a professional, understanding the capabilities and limitations of edge AI accelerators is vital for achieving maximum efficiency and low costs.

So, what do you think? Are you excited about the potential of edge AI accelerators? Let me know in the comments! 👇","Here's a LinkedIn post summarizing the text:

**Unlocking AI Potential at the Edge: A Closer Look at Energy-Constrained Accelerators**

As I delved into the world of Artificial Intelligence (AI) accelerators for energy-constrained edge devices, I was struck by the diverse range of technologies and devices available. From Huawei's Atlas family to Google Coral and Intel Neural Compute Stick 2, each accelerator offers unique features and capabilities.

I explored devices with up to 40W TDP, excluding those tied to a single device like cameras. Theoretical maximum performances were specified for most devices, but power draw numbers were often lacking or had to be calculated using the maximal possible power draw.

Standout accelerators include Bearkey's Rockchip chips, Bitmain Sophon Edge Developer Board (BSEDB) with its Sophon BM1880 ASIC, and Orange PI AI Stick Lite (OPAI) with a Lightspeeur SPR2801S neural accelerator.

As I dug deeper, it became clear that there's a need for guidelines on deploying AI applications efficiently and cost-effectively. By examining these devices further, we can unlock their full potential and create a more sustainable future for AI at the edge.

What are your thoughts on the current state of AI accelerators? How do you see them evolving in the future? 🤔💡"," Hey there! I wanted to share some interesting information I came across about Edge AI accelerators for energy-constrained edge devices. These are devices that help speed up artificial intelligence (AI) tasks and come in various forms.

One example is the Huawei Atlas family, which includes the 200, 300, 500, 800, and 900 series, each with a different purpose. Another company called Bearkey uses Rockchip chips and has been collaborating with Linaro and 96Boards since at least 2019.

Google's Coral family is based on the same Edge Tensor Processing Unit (Edge TPU). Their platform currently features only a single SBC, module, and stick, including the Bitmain Sophon Edge Developer Board. This board is equipped with a Sophon BM1880 ASIC that can provide up to 1 TOPS or 2 TOPS with Winograd acceleration.

Intel's Neural Compute Stick 2 utilizes Intel Movidius Myriad X Vision Processing Unit and has 16 SHAVE cores and 4GB of RAM for deep neural network inference. Google Coral USB Accelerator also uses the same Edge TPU as its family.

The Orange PI AI Stick Lite is equipped with a Lightspeeur SPR2801S neural accelerator, while Rockchip RK1808 AI Compute stick features a standalone NPU from RK3399Pro chip.

Unfortunately, the power draw of some of these Single Board Computers (SBCs) isn't officially specified yet, but we can calculate it based on the maximum possible power draw.

With so many options available, it's important to research these devices further and create guidelines for deploying AI applications efficiently and cost-effectively.

Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications.

Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

The body map form is a special tool used by healthcare professionals to record important information about a pa- tient’s health. The web app is designed to be simple, clear and intuitive, with an emphasis on usability and accessibility. When registering, the user registers us- ing a simple form, where he must fill in a username, email address and password. The dashboard window contains a pair of graphs that provide information about the vital functions of the patient’s body. Paediatric tracheostomy safety checklist protocol is a list of steps that the caregiver must check and record on the form. In the paper version of the form, the list was divided into seven working days and each day was further divided into day and night shifts. A chronologi- cal record was chosen, where the date and day of the week are added to each record. This approach has made it easier and faster to complete the form without having to manually split the records into days and shifts. The application was developed locally and deployed on the MS Azure cloud platform for testing purposes. a scenario designed to test the editing of the caregiver profile. Our final test scenario is shown in Table 3 and aims totest the possibility of displaying the data to patients. The application was generally positively evaluated, and users had no reserva- tions about the design and functionality. The graph high- lights that the application was stable and operated effectively. we developed an efficient system for storing information from medical records.

FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network.

#FederatedLearning #HealthcareAI #PrivacyPreserving #EdgeComputing #MachineLearning #HealthcareInnovation"," Hello there! In the world of technology, Federated Learning (FL) is becoming increasingly popular, especially in edge computing and IoT environments. It's a promising approach that allows devices at the edge of a network to collaborate and learn collectively while keeping data local, thus ensuring privacy.

With FL, each device trains its own model on its own data and then shares only the learned model with other devices. This process is repeated over several rounds until all devices have an updated model that reflects the collective knowledge. This way, sensitive data doesn't need to be shared, making it ideal for applications in healthcare or finance where privacy is paramount.

As you mentioned, scalability of FL systems is a subject of further studies. Improving communication between devices, increasing data transfer, and better coverage are areas of focus. Future edge devices might use 5G and 6G networks for communication to enhance these capabilities.

However, sharing private data comes with risks such as data leakage and privacy breaches. To address this, researchers are working on various privacy-preserving methods for FL. One such method is differential privacy, which adds noise to the shared models to prevent any one participant's data from being identified.

It seems like you're interested in the intersection of FL and various other technologies, such as blockchain, Intelligent Edge Computing, 6G networks, and more. There are numerous studies available that delve into these topics. Here are a few that might interest you:

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Let's continue to explore, innovate, and push the boundaries of what's possible with FL – for the sake of our collective future. 🚀💻"," In the rapidly evolving landscape of technology, Federated Learning (FL) is emerging as a promising approach to leverage the computational power of edge devices in IoT networks. With the increasing number of connected devices participating in model training, scalability becomes paramount for FL systems.

Future research will focus on improving communication efficiency between these devices, enhancing data transfer capabilities, and expanding coverage. The advent of 5G and 6G networks could potentially revolutionize communication at the edge. However, privacy remains a critical concern as sharing sensitive data increases network vulnerability to data leakage.

Applications of FL span various sectors, particularly in healthcare and finance, where privacy is essential due to inherent sensitivity. This article provides an overview of the FL paradigm, its recent advancements, and future directions. It's exciting to see how FL enables digital twins for smart cities, fosters intelligence edge computing in 6G, and enhances application of machine learning for IoT devices.

However, as we delve deeper into this fascinating world, challenges arise. Balancing non-IID data at the IoT edge using peer-to-peer FL for anomaly detection is one such challenge. The EU GDPR and California's CCPA are becoming de facto global standards for data privacy and protection.

FL is also being applied in smart city sensing, autonomous vehicles, credit risk assessment, attack detection in medical cyber-physical systems, collaborative manufacturing for complex parts, and many more domains. Innovations such as asynchronous FL for geospatial applications and selective model aggregation approaches in vehicular edge computing are further pushing the boundaries of what's possible with FL.

Moreover, scalable and low-latency federated learning with cooperative mobile edge networking is being developed to address communication overhead issues. Machine learning for intelligent reflecting surface-based wireless communication towards 6G is another intriguing development in this field.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

🤖 AI Accelerators for Energy-Constrained Edge Devices: A Brief Overview 🤖

As the demand for efficient AI applications continues to grow, researchers are exploring various edge AI accelerators designed for energy-constrained devices. A recent study examined a range of devices with up to 40W TDP, excluding those tied to a single device like cameras.

The study highlighted several notable edge AI accelerators, including Huawei's Atlas family, Bearkey's Rockchip-based solutions, Google Coral family, and Intel Neural Compute Stick 2, among others. Each of these devices offers unique features and capabilities, such as high-performance processing units, neural accelerators, and support for various AI models.

While the theoretical max performance of these devices is impressive, there is a need to further examine their power draw and develop guidelines on how to deploy AI applications efficiently. This is particularly important in healthcare settings where energy efficiency can have a significant impact on costs and resource allocation.

As researchers continue to push the boundaries of edge AI capabilities, it's essential to consider the energy constraints of these devices and optimize their performance for real-world applications."," Healthcare professionals,

In the realm of Edge Artificial Intelligence (AI), a significant development is unfolding with the introduction of AI Accelerators designed for energy-constrained edge devices. These accelerators, powered by various technologies, can offer up to 40W TDP. Notably, they exclude devices directly tied to a single device such as a camera.

The Huawei Atlas family, consisting of 200, 300, 500, 800, and 900 series, each with unique purposes, is one such accelerator. Bearkey, using Rockchip chips, has collaborated with Linaro and 96Boards since at least 2019. The Google Coral family, based on the Edge Tensor Processing Unit (Edge TPU), also partners with 96Boards. Currently, their platform only features a single SBC, module, and stick, the Bitmain Sophon Edge Developer Board. This board boasts a Sophon BM1880 ASIC that can deliver up to 2 TOPS with Winograd acceleration.

The Intel Neural Compute Stick 2 utilizes Intel Movidius Myriad X Vision Processing Unit, featuring 16 SHAVE cores and 4GB of RAM for deep neural network inference. The Google Coral USB Accelerator is built around the same Edge TPU as the Coral family. The Orange PI AI Stick Lite is equipped with a Lightspeeur SPR2801S neural accelerator. Lastly, the Rockchip RK1808 AI Compute stick features a standalone NPU from RK3399Pro chip.

However, it's crucial to further examine these devices and create guidelines on how, when, and where to deploy AI applications to achieve maximum efficiency and low costs. This will ensure that we leverage the power of Edge AI in our healthcare sector effectively. 🔬💻💪

This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices.

The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Digitization increases accessibility, improves communication between healthcare pro- fessionals, and offers better monitoring and transparency in patient care. Health record digitization applications are software tools that enable the digitization and storage of patient health records. Some apps also enable doctor-patient commu- nication, online appointment scheduling and management, and real-time tracking of health data and outcomes. These apps improve patient care treatment efficiency and increase patient satisfaction. The objective of this paper is to design and implement a web-based application that facilitates doctors in maintain- ing and accessing patient records. This digital platform aims to streamline the process of updating individual pa- tient profiles with pertinent health information. The paper will describe the development of both fron- tend and backend technologies. System architecture delineates specific roles for its users, with a particular emphasis on two pri- mary roles: patients and doctors. For patients, the system grants exclusive access to their individual health records. Doctor or caregiver possess the capability to access the records of all pa- tients under their care, including those they have personally added or managed. A paper version of this form is shown in Fig. 3. The pediatric tracheostomy safety checklist is a form that contains a list of measures that the caregiver must check and record on the form. The body map form is a special tool used by healthcare professionals to record important information about a pa- tient’s health. The web app is designed to be simple, clear and intuitive, with an emphasis on usability and accessibility. When registering, the user registers us- ing a simple form, where he must fill in a username, email address and password. The dashboard window contains a pair of graphs that provide information about the vital functions of the patient’s body. Paediatric tracheostomy safety checklist protocol is a list of steps that the caregiver must check and record on the form.

It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

**Federated Learning: The Key to Unlocking IoT Potential**

Hey fellow [Non-Profit Organization] members! 🤝 As we continue to explore the vast possibilities of Internet of Things (IoT), I wanted to share some insights on Federated Learning (FL) - a game-changer for our industry. 🚀

In FL, each client contributes their unique data, which is then used to train a shared model. Sounds simple, but the devil lies in the details! 🤔 The training data of each client depends heavily on the devices they use, leading to diverse data distributions among clients.

To address this challenge, we need efficient scheduling techniques that balance computation power and communication costs. Synchronous and asynchronous approaches exist, but FL requires caution when working with IoT devices - those constraints can be significant! 💡

Scalability is also crucial in FL, as many clients may participate in model training. I'm excited to see how future research will improve communication, data transfer, and coverage.

Lastly, privacy concerns are a top priority in FL, especially for sensitive applications like healthcare or finance. As we continue to explore this field, we must prioritize protecting our members' and users' private data.

If you're as enthusiastic about FL as I am, check out some of the recent surveys, articles, and research papers on Federated Learning (FL) - there's a wealth of knowledge waiting to be unlocked! 💡","Here is a LinkedIn post summarizing the text:

**Federated Learning: Unlocking Edge Computing Potential**

As I delve into the world of federated learning (FL), I'm excited to share my insights on its applications and challenges. FL is gaining popularity, especially in edge computing environments where data distribution across clients can be quite different.

One key aspect is scheduling techniques, which need to be tailored to handle computationally intensive tasks and accommodate devices with limited power, such as IoT devices. Scalability is crucial, and future improvements could focus on enhancing communication between devices, increasing data transfer, and expanding coverage.

However, FL also raises concerns about data privacy and security, particularly in sensitive industries like healthcare and finance. As we move forward, it's essential to prioritize privacy-preserving designs and ensure that FL systems are secure and trustworthy.

I'm eager to explore the vast potential of FL in smart cities, IoT, and other areas, where its decentralized and collaborative approach can unlock new possibilities. What are your thoughts on federated learning? How do you see it shaping the future of edge computing? 🤔💻"," In the rapidly evolving landscape of technology, Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm that holds immense potential, particularly in IoT environments. FL allows devices on the edge of the network to collaboratively learn and adapt models without sharing raw data, making it a promising approach for sensitive applications such as healthcare and finance.

One of the key challenges in FL systems is scalability, as many devices can participate in model training. Future studies could focus on improving communication between these devices, increasing data transfer rates, and ensuring better coverage. With the advent of 5G and potentially 6G networks, edge devices may leverage these advanced communication technologies for data exchange.

However, privacy remains a critical concern as sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and breaches. To address this issue, FL systems employ techniques such as differential privacy, secure multi-party computation, and homomorphic encryption.

Another challenge is that devices may train at different times due to varying memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. This issue can be addressed through strategies like data re-balancing and peer-to-peer learning.

In terms of regulations, the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) are becoming increasingly influential as de facto global standards for data privacy and protection.

In conclusion, FL is a promising approach that offers numerous benefits while addressing key challenges through ongoing research. As a researcher in this field, I find it fascinating to explore the potential of FL in various applications, from smart cities and autonomous vehicles to healthcare and beyond. 🌐🚀"

**Unlocking AI Potential at the Edge: A Review of Energy-Constrained Accelerators**

As I delved into the world of Edge AI accelerators, I was struck by the diverse range of devices available for energy-constrained edge applications. From Huawei's Atlas family to Google Coral and Bearkey's Rockchip-based solutions, each offers unique strengths and purposes.

In my research, I examined various devices with up to 40W TDP, excluding those tied to a single device like cameras. Notably, some boards and sticks lack official power draw numbers, so I calculated them using the maximum possible power draw.

Theoretical max performance of these devices is impressive, but there's a need for further examination and guidelines on deploying AI applications efficiently and cost-effectively. For instance, Intel's Neural Compute Stick 2 utilizes Movidius Myriad X Vision Processing Unit with 16 SHAVE cores and 4GB RAM, while Orange PI AI Stick Lite features a Lightspeeur SPR2801S neural accelerator.

As we continue to push the boundaries of Edge AI, it's essential to consider the complexities of these devices and their applications. I believe that creating guidelines for deployment will be crucial in achieving maximum efficiency and minimizing costs.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Digitization increases accessibility, improves communication between healthcare pro- fessionals, and offers better monitoring and transparency in patient care. Health record digitization applications are software tools that enable the digitization and storage of patient health records. Some apps also enable doctor-patient commu- nication, online appointment scheduling and management, and real-time tracking of health data and outcomes. These apps improve patient care treatment efficiency and increase patient satisfaction. The objective of this paper is to design and implement a web-based application that facilitates doctors in maintain- ing and accessing patient records. This digital platform aims to streamline the process of updating individual pa- tient profiles with pertinent health information. The paper will describe the development of both fron- tend and backend technologies. System architecture delineates specific roles for its users, with a particular emphasis on two pri- mary roles: patients and doctors. For patients, the system grants exclusive access to their individual health records. Doctor or caregiver possess the capability to access the records of all pa- tients under their care, including those they have personally added or managed. A paper version of this form is shown in Fig. 3. The pediatric tracheostomy safety checklist is a form that contains a list of measures that the caregiver must check and record on the form. The body map form is a special tool used by healthcare professionals to record important information about a pa- tient’s health. The web app is designed to be simple, clear and intuitive, with an emphasis on usability and accessibility. When registering, the user registers us- ing a simple form, where he must fill in a username, email address and password. The dashboard window contains a pair of graphs that provide information about the vital functions of the patient’s body. Paediatric tracheostomy safety checklist protocol is a list of steps that the caregiver must check and record on the form. In the paper version of the form, the list was divided into seven working days and each day was further divided into day and night shifts. A chronologi- cal record was chosen, where the date and day of the week are added to each record. This approach has made it easier and faster to complete the form without having to manually split the records into days and shifts. The application was developed locally and deployed on the MS Azure cloud platform for testing purposes. a scenario designed to test the editing of the caregiver profile. Our final test scenario is shown in Table 3 and aims totest the possibility of displaying the data to patients. The application was generally positively evaluated, and users had no reserva- tions about the design and functionality. The graph high- lights that the application was stable and operated effectively. we developed an efficient system for storing information from medical records. Finally, using the React.js and Express.js frameworks, we successfully created a web application dedicated to digitizing records.

Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

**Federated Learning: A Promising Approach for Edge Computing**

As researchers in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning, we are excited to explore the potential of federated learning (FL) as a promising approach for edge computing. In FL, local devices collaboratively train a shared model without sharing their training data with each other.

In this paradigm, each client has its own unique characteristics, such as varying computational power, memory size, and availability, which can affect the number of data samples used in training. This requires careful scheduling techniques to optimize task execution and minimize communication overhead.

Our research has shown that FL is particularly well-suited for applications in healthcare, finance, and smart cities, where privacy is a major concern. By leveraging the increasing computational power of edge devices, FL can enable digital twins and improve the scalability and efficiency of IoT systems.

Recent advances in federated learning have focused on addressing issues such as non-IID data, communication overhead, and security and privacy concerns. Our survey of existing literature highlights the potential applications and challenges in this area, including the use of blockchain and 5G/6G networks for communication.

We believe that federated learning has the potential to revolutionize edge computing by enabling collaborative machine learning while preserving data privacy and security. As researchers, we are excited to continue exploring the possibilities of FL and its applications in various domains.

As researchers in the field of federated learning (FL), we are well aware of the unique challenges that arise when training machine learning models on decentralized data. The distribution of client data can be vastly different, and the computational power of local devices can vary significantly.

Scheduling tasks effectively is crucial in FL, particularly when working with IoT devices that have limited processing capabilities. Moreover, ensuring scalability is essential to accommodate a large number of clients participating in model training.

Privacy concerns are also paramount, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance, where data sharing is often impossible. To address these challenges, we must develop innovative solutions for communication, data transfer, and coverage, potentially leveraging 5G and 6G networks.

Our review of recent advances in FL highlights the potential of this paradigm to unlock the power of edge devices. However, we must continue to explore ways to improve scalability, communication, and privacy in FL systems.

As we move forward, it is essential that we prioritize these considerations to fully realize the benefits of federated learning in various applications, including smart cities, healthcare informatics, and beyond."," In the field of IoT and edge computing, Federated Learning (FL) is gaining popularity as a promising approach to utilize the computational power of devices on the network's edge. FL allows these devices to collaboratively learn a model without sharing their private data, making it particularly useful in sensitive applications such as healthcare or finance.

Scalability of FL systems is an area of ongoing research due to the increasing number of clients participating in model training. Improving communication between devices, increasing data transfer, and ensuring better coverage are key areas for future work. The use of 5G and 6G networks for communication among edge devices could be a potential solution.

Privacy is essential in FL, as sharing private data can make the network vulnerable to data leakage. To address this, various approaches like differential privacy or secure multi-party computation are being explored. Additionally, the varying training times of different participants due to differences in memory sizes and availability affect the number of data samples, which can impact model performance.

Future work could also focus on creating efficient data rebalancing strategies at IoT edge devices for anomaly detection using peer-to-peer FL. As global standards for data privacy and protection, the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) are becoming increasingly influential, although it remains to be seen if they will become de facto global standards.

In terms of research direction, surveys have been conducted on various aspects of FL, including its application in IoT, security and privacy, healthcare informatics, blockchain integration, and more. Recent advances in edge-computing-powered artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) are also being explored. Communication efficiency for FL on non-IID data is a topic of ongoing study, with strategies like knowledge distillation being proposed to reduce communication overhead. Asynchronous FL for geospatial applications and selective model aggregation in vehicular edge computing are other promising areas of research.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Digitization increases accessibility, improves communication between healthcare pro- fessionals, and offers better monitoring and transparency in patient care. Health record digitization applications are software tools that enable the digitization and storage of patient health records. Some apps also enable doctor-patient commu- nication, online appointment scheduling and management, and real-time tracking of health data and outcomes. These apps improve patient care treatment efficiency and increase patient satisfaction. The objective of this paper is to design and implement a web-based application that facilitates doctors in maintain- ing and accessing patient records. This digital platform aims to streamline the process of updating individual pa- tient profiles with pertinent health information. The paper will describe the development of both fron- tend and backend technologies. System architecture delineates specific roles for its users, with a particular emphasis on two pri- mary roles: patients and doctors. For patients, the system grants exclusive access to their individual health records. Doctor or caregiver possess the capability to access the records of all pa- tients under their care, including those they have personally added or managed. A paper version of this form is shown in Fig. 3. The pediatric tracheostomy safety checklist is a form that contains a list of measures that the caregiver must check and record on the form. The body map form is a special tool used by healthcare professionals to record important information about a pa- tient’s health. The web app is designed to be simple, clear and intuitive, with an emphasis on usability and accessibility. When registering, the user registers us- ing a simple form, where he must fill in a username, email address and password. The dashboard window contains a pair of graphs that provide information about the vital functions of the patient’s body. Paediatric tracheostomy safety checklist protocol is a list of steps that the caregiver must check and record on the form. In the paper version of the form, the list was divided into seven working days and each day was further divided into day and night shifts. A chronologi- cal record was chosen, where the date and day of the week are added to each record. This approach has made it easier and faster to complete the form without having to manually split the records into days and shifts. The application was developed locally and deployed on the MS Azure cloud platform for testing purposes. a scenario designed to test the editing of the caregiver profile. Our final test scenario is shown in Table 3 and aims totest the possibility of displaying the data to patients. The application was generally positively evaluated, and users had no reserva- tions about the design and functionality. The graph high- lights that the application was stable and operated effectively. we developed an efficient system for storing information from medical records.

Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

**Federated Learning: Unlocking the Power of Edge Computing**

As we move towards a world where devices are increasingly connected and data is being generated at an unprecedented scale, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach to harness this power. In FL, multiple devices or clients learn from their local data without sharing it with each other or a central authority.

**Key Characteristics**

FL requires careful scheduling of tasks, particularly when dealing with Internet of Things (IoT) devices that have limited computational power. The process must also be highly scalable to accommodate the large number of clients participating in model training. Moreover, FL systems must ensure privacy and security, as sharing private data can make the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy breaches.

**Recent Advances**

Researchers have made significant progress in developing FL algorithms and applications, including those focused on healthcare, finance, and smart cities. For instance, FL has been used to create digital twins for smart cities, enabling real-time monitoring and decision-making. Additionally, FL has been applied to various domains such as anomaly detection, human mobility prediction, and credit risk assessment.

**Future Directions**

As we move towards the next generation of wireless networks (5G and 6G), FL will play a crucial role in enabling edge computing and reducing latency. Furthermore, the integration of blockchain technology with ML can provide an additional layer of security and privacy for FL applications.

**Why Federated Learning Matters**

FL has the potential to revolutionize the way we process data at the edge, ensuring privacy and security while unlocking new insights and applications. As we continue to push the boundaries of what is possible, it's essential to address the challenges and open issues in FL research.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE.

PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles.

Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Health record digitization applications are software tools that enable the digitization and storage of patient health records. Some apps also enable doctor-patient commu- nication, online appointment scheduling and management, and real-time tracking of health data and outcomes. These apps improve patient care treatment efficiency and increase patient satisfaction. The objective of this paper is to design and implement a web-based application that facilitates doctors in maintain- ing and accessing patient records. This digital platform aims to streamline the process of updating individual pa- tient profiles with pertinent health information. The paper will describe the development of both fron- tend and backend technologies. System architecture delineates specific roles for its users, with a particular emphasis on two pri- mary roles: patients and doctors.

They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing.

Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Digitization increases accessibility, improves communication between healthcare pro- fessionals, and offers better monitoring and transparency in patient care. Health record digitization applications are software tools that enable the digitization and storage of patient health records. Some apps also enable doctor-patient commu- nication, online appointment scheduling and management, and real-time tracking of health data and outcomes. These apps improve patient care treatment efficiency and increase patient satisfaction. The objective of this paper is to design and implement a web-based application that facilitates doctors in maintain- ing and accessing patient records. This digital platform aims to streamline the process of updating individual pa- tient profiles with pertinent health information. The paper will describe the development of both fron- tend and backend technologies. System architecture delineates specific roles for its users, with a particular emphasis on two pri- mary roles: patients and doctors. For patients, the system grants exclusive access to their individual health records. Doctor or caregiver possess the capability to access the records of all pa- tients under their care, including those they have personally added or managed. A paper version of this form is shown in Fig. 3. The pediatric tracheostomy safety checklist is a form that contains a list of measures that the caregiver must check and record on the form. The body map form is a special tool used by healthcare professionals to record important information about a pa- tient’s health. The web app is designed to be simple, clear and intuitive, with an emphasis on usability and accessibility. When registering, the user registers us- ing a simple form, where he must fill in a username, email address and password. The dashboard window contains a pair of graphs that provide information about the vital functions of the patient’s body. Paediatric tracheostomy safety checklist protocol is a list of steps that the caregiver must check and record on the form. In the paper version of the form, the list was divided into seven working days and each day was further divided into day and night shifts. A chronologi- cal record was chosen, where the date and day of the week are added to each record. This approach has made it easier and faster to complete the form without having to manually split the records into days and shifts. The application was developed locally and deployed on the MS Azure cloud platform for testing purposes. a scenario designed to test the editing of the caregiver profile. Our final test scenario is shown in Table 3 and aims totest the possibility of displaying the data to patients. The application was generally positively evaluated, and users had no reserva- tions about the design and functionality. The graph high- lights that the application was stable and operated effectively. we developed an efficient system for storing information from medical records. Finally, using the React.js and Express.js frameworks, we successfully created a web application dedicated to digitizing records. The application uses the MongoDB database for safe and efficient data storage. This paper highlights the advancements in web application development and enables the provision of a functional and user-friendly digital solu- tion for health record management.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

""As entrepreneurs, we're always on the lookout for innovative ways to harness the power of data. That's why I'm excited to share my thoughts on Federated Learning (FL) - a game-changer in the world of IoT and AI.

In traditional distributed optimization problems, FL stands out due to its unique characteristics. For instance, scheduling techniques are crucial when working with computationally intensive tasks and IoT devices with limited resources. And let's not forget about scalability - we need our systems to be able to handle a large number of clients participating in model training.

But what really gets me excited is the potential for FL to revolutionize industries like healthcare and finance, where data privacy is paramount. Imagine being able to train AI models on sensitive data without compromising security or anonymity.

As I dive deeper into the world of FL, I'm struck by the sheer breadth of applications - from smart cities to autonomous vehicles. And with the rise of 5G and 6G networks, I'm confident that we'll see even more innovative use cases emerge.

So, if you're as fascinated by FL as I am, let's stay ahead of the curve together! Check out some of the latest research papers and articles on Federated Learning, and let's explore how we can apply this technology to drive real-world impact. #FederatedLearning #IoT #AI""

**""Federated Learning: The Ultimate Team Player for IoT and Edge Devices?""**

As we dive deeper into the world of Internet of Things (IoT) and edge devices, one thing becomes clear - federated learning is the ultimate team player. But what makes it so special?

For starters, FL allows us to train models on local devices without sharing sensitive data, making it a game-changer for industries like healthcare and finance where privacy is paramount.

However, with great power comes great responsibility (and some pesky challenges). Scheduling tasks can be a nightmare, especially when working with IoT devices that have limited computational power. And let's not forget about the communication overhead - it's like trying to get a group of friends to agree on a restaurant for dinner!

But despite these hurdles, FL is still a promising approach for harnessing the power of edge devices. With its ability to scale and accommodate diverse data distributions, it's no wonder it's gaining popularity.

So, what's next? Improving communication between devices, increasing data transfer speeds, and better coverage are just a few areas that need further exploration.

As we continue to navigate the world of FL, one thing is clear - it's not just about the tech, but about building a robust system that can support diverse applications and use cases. And who knows? Maybe future edge devices will even use 5G and 6G networks for communication!

#FederatedLearning #IoT #EdgeDevices #MachineLearning #Privacy #Security #Scalability #FutureOfTech"," In the rapidly evolving world of edge computing and IoT, federated learning (FL) is becoming increasingly popular due to its potential to harness the computational power of devices on the network's edge. FL allows for privacy-preserving machine learning by training models across multiple devices without sharing private data.

Currently, studies are focusing on improving communication between devices, increasing data transfer efficiency, and providing better coverage, especially with the advent of 5G and 6G networks. However, challenges remain, such as potential data leakage, disparities in training times due to device capabilities, and maintaining compliance with data privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA.

In smart cities, FL is enabling digital twins that can learn and adapt in real-time, leading to more efficient resource management and improved quality of life for citizens. Furthermore, FL is being applied across various sectors, from healthcare to finance, where sensitive data sharing is often impossible or restricted.

Recent advancements in FL include techniques like peer-to-peer learning, on-device learning, and asynchronous learning, which aim to improve efficiency, reduce communication overhead, and adapt to non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) data scenarios. Additionally, researchers are exploring the intersection of FL with technologies like blockchain and intelligent reflecting surfaces for wireless communication towards 6G networks.

As entrepreneurs in this space, we should stay updated on the latest developments, challenges, and potential use cases of FL to capitalize on its vast potential.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

One exciting development could be edge devices using 5G and 6G networks for seamless communication, paving the way for smarter cities and more efficient IoT systems. 🚀🏙️

However, privacy remains a top concern in FL applications due to the sharing of private data. To address this issue, ongoing research is being conducted on security and privacy preservation methods, ensuring that sensitive data remains protected. 🔒👀

The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) are becoming de facto global standards for data privacy and protection, guiding our work in this area. 🇪🇺🌞📈

Our journey continues as we explore the challenges and opportunities of FL in smart city sensing, on-device federated learning, real-world implementation of FL for breast density classification, and privacy-aware service placement for mobile edge computing, among others. 🌆🚀💡

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

#FederatedLearning #AIinIoT #EdgeComputing #PrivacyMatters #NonProfitOrg"," In the rapidly evolving world of technology, Federated Learning (FL) is gaining popularity as a promising approach for harnessing the computational power of devices on the edge of the network. This paradigm is particularly useful in sensitive applications like healthcare and finance where data privacy is paramount.

 FL allows multiple clients to participate in model training, making it highly scalable. However, scaling FL systems is still a subject of further studies. Improvements can be made in communication between devices, increasing data transfer, and ensuring better coverage. The future may see edge devices using 5G and 6G networks for communication.

 privacy remains a concern as sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage. To address this, FL employs techniques that keep data local while still allowing for model training. This is crucial for applications where data sharing is often impossible or highly regulated, like in healthcare and finance.

 As Europe and California move towards stricter data privacy standards with the EU GDPR and CCPA, these regulations may become de facto global standards.

 We, as a non-profit organization, are excited about the recent advances in FL for IoT, including applications like digital twins for smart cities, credit risk assessment, anomaly detection, and more. We're also keen on exploring the intersection of FL with other emerging technologies like blockchain and Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) for wireless communication towards 6G.

 However, there are still many open challenges and issues to be addressed, such as dealing with non-IID data, improving communication efficiency, and ensuring scalability and low latency.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices.

The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Federated Learning: The Promising Approach for IoT and Edge Computing

As we continue to rely on devices on the edge of our networks, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach to harness their computational power. However, FL also poses specific challenges that require careful consideration.

One key issue is data distribution. Since each client's training data depends heavily on local device usage, connected clients may have vastly different data distributions. This requires caution when scheduling tasks, especially with IoT devices that have limited computational resources.

Another challenge is scalability. As many clients can participate in model training, FL systems must be designed to handle large-scale computations. Future work could focus on improving communication between devices and increasing data transfer rates.

But what about privacy concerns? Sharing private data can make the network vulnerable to data leakage and compromise. In applications like healthcare or finance, where data is extremely sensitive, sharing these data is often impossible.

Despite these challenges, FL holds great potential for smart cities and IoT applications. By leveraging the computational power of edge devices, we can create digital twins and enable more efficient processing.

To learn more about FL and its applications, I recommend checking out some recent surveys and studies on the topic. From machine learning to blockchain and beyond, there's a wealth of knowledge waiting to be explored.

As you navigate the world of federated learning, remember that privacy is key. By protecting sensitive data and leveraging edge computing, we can unlock new possibilities for IoT applications and create a more connected world.","Here is a LinkedIn post summarizing the text:

As you explore the world of federated learning (FL), you're likely to encounter specific issues that can make or break your project. One major challenge is the varying data distribution among connected clients, which can lead to scalability and communication hurdles.

When working with IoT devices, scheduling techniques become crucial to address computationally intensive tasks. Existing optimization methods can be categorized into synchronous and asynchronous approaches, but FL requires a more cautious approach due to device limitations.

Scalability is another critical aspect of FL systems, particularly in IoT environments where many clients participate in model training. Future work could focus on improving communication between devices, increasing data transfer, and enhancing coverage - possibly leveraging 5G and 6G networks.

However, sharing private data can make the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy breaches. Different participants train at varying times due to differences in memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples.

Despite these challenges, FL is a promising approach for harnessing the computational power of edge devices. Its applications in healthcare and finance are particularly significant, where privacy is paramount.

As you delve deeper into FL, it's essential to consider its characteristics, challenges, and potential use cases - especially in the context of smart cities, edge computing, and 6G networks. By doing so, you can unlock the full potential of this emerging technology and drive meaningful innovation in your organization."," It seems like you've gathered quite an impressive collection of research articles related to Federated Learning (FL), especially in the context of IoT, edge computing, and privacy. This is indeed a promising area with great potential for applications such as smart cities, healthcare, finance, and more.

For your non-profit organization members, I'd like to highlight a few key points from the articles you've shared:

1. Scalability of FL systems in an IoT environment is crucial, and future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. This could be facilitated by emerging technologies such as 5G and 6G networks for communication.

2. Privacy is a significant concern when dealing with sensitive data like healthcare or financial information. FL can help protect this data by keeping it on the edge devices and only sharing model updates instead of raw data.

3. One challenge in FL is the non-IID ( Independent and Identically Distributed) nature of data among participants due to differences in memory sizes, availability, and training times. Techniques like data re-balancing at IoT edge with peer-to-peer FL for anomaly detection could be useful here.

4. As your organization focuses on privacy and protection, it's worth noting that regulations like the EU GDPR and California CCPA are gaining traction as de facto global standards for data privacy and protection.

5. Lastly, keep an eye out for advancements in edge-computing-powered AIoT (Artificial Intelligence of Things) and intelligent reflecting surface-based wireless communication towards 6G, which could significantly impact the scalability and efficiency of FL systems in the future.

I hope these insights help guide your organization's research and collaboration efforts in this exciting field! If you have any specific questions or need further clarification on any of these topics, feel free to ask!"

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Digitization increases accessibility, improves communication between healthcare pro- fessionals, and offers better monitoring and transparency in patient care. Health record digitization applications are software tools that enable the digitization and storage of patient health records. Some apps also enable doctor-patient commu- nication, online appointment scheduling and management, and real-time tracking of health data and outcomes. These apps improve patient care treatment efficiency and increase patient satisfaction. The objective of this paper is to design and implement a web-based application that facilitates doctors in maintain- ing and accessing patient records. This digital platform aims to streamline the process of updating individual pa- tient profiles with pertinent health information. The paper will describe the development of both fron- tend and backend technologies. System architecture delineates specific roles for its users, with a particular emphasis on two pri- mary roles: patients and doctors. For patients, the system grants exclusive access to their individual health records. Doctor or caregiver possess the capability to access the records of all pa- tients under their care, including those they have personally added or managed. A paper version of this form is shown in Fig. 3. The pediatric tracheostomy safety checklist is a form that contains a list of measures that the caregiver must check and record on the form. The body map form is a special tool used by healthcare professionals to record important information about a pa- tient’s health. The web app is designed to be simple, clear and intuitive, with an emphasis on usability and accessibility. When registering, the user registers us- ing a simple form, where he must fill in a username, email address and password. The dashboard window contains a pair of graphs that provide information about the vital functions of the patient’s body. Paediatric tracheostomy safety checklist protocol is a list of steps that the caregiver must check and record on the form. In the paper version of the form, the list was divided into seven working days and each day was further divided into day and night shifts. A chronologi- cal record was chosen, where the date and day of the week are added to each record. This approach has made it easier and faster to complete the form without having to manually split the records into days and shifts. The application was developed locally and deployed on the MS Azure cloud platform for testing purposes. a scenario designed to test the editing of the caregiver profile. Our final test scenario is shown in Table 3 and aims totest the possibility of displaying the data to patients. The application was generally positively evaluated, and users had no reserva- tions about the design and functionality.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

This digital platform aims to streamline the process of updating individual pa- tient profiles with pertinent health information. The paper will describe the development of both fron- tend and backend technologies. System architecture delineates specific roles for its users, with a particular emphasis on two pri- mary roles: patients and doctors. For patients, the system grants exclusive access to their individual health records. Doctor or caregiver possess the capability to access the records of all pa- tients under their care, including those they have personally added or managed.

A chronologi- cal record was chosen, where the date and day of the week are added to each record. This approach has made it easier and faster to complete the form without having to manually split the records into days and shifts. The application was developed locally and deployed on the MS Azure cloud platform for testing purposes. a scenario designed to test the editing of the caregiver profile. Our final test scenario is shown in Table 3 and aims totest the possibility of displaying the data to patients.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

#EdgeAI #EnergyEfficiency #AIAccelerators #EngineeringExcellence"," Title: Discovering the Power of Edge AI Accelerators: A Comprehensive Overview for Engineers

Hello, fellow engineers!

I wanted to share with you an intriguing exploration into the realm of Edge AI Accelerators, particularly focusing on energy-constrained edge devices. This fascinating topic is brought to us by our colleagues from the Department of Cybernetics and Artificial Intelligence at the Technical University of Košice, Slovakia.

The landscape of AI Accelerators is vast and diverse, encompassing various devices employing different technologies. Some of these accelerators are available in multiple form factors, such as boards, sticks, and modules. It's essential to note that we've limited our scope to devices up to 40W TDP, excluding those directly tied to a single device like cameras.

Let's dive into some noteworthy examples. The Huawei Atlas family includes the 200, 300, 500, 800, and 900 series, each with distinct purposes and aims.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

As you navigate the ever-evolving world of technology, have you heard about Federated Learning (FL)? It's like having a superpower in your pocket - except instead of saving the world from evil villains, FL helps organizations harness the power of their devices to improve model training. 

Think of it this way: Imagine having thousands of smart devices working together to train an AI model, each with its unique characteristics and data. That's what Federated Learning is all about! It's like a digital puzzle that requires careful planning, execution, and - above all - scalability.

But don't worry; you're not alone in this quest for FL mastery. There are countless research papers, studies, and innovative solutions out there waiting to be explored. From healthcare to finance, from smart cities to IoT, Federated Learning has the potential to revolutionize the way we work and live.

So, take a deep breath, grab your favorite cup of coffee (or tea), and dive into the fascinating world of Federated Learning!","Here is a LinkedIn post summarizing the text in a humorous tone:

""As you navigate the complex world of federated learning, you're probably thinking, 'Wait, how do I make this work with all these different devices and clients?' Well, buckle up, friend, because we're about to dive into the wild west of FL.

First off, let's talk scheduling. You've got computationally intensive tasks, IoT devices with limited power, and a whole lot of variability in data distribution. It's like trying to herd cats - except those cats are actually devices with different memory sizes and availability.

But don't worry, FL is designed to be highly scalable, which means it can handle all those clients participating in model training. And with the rise of 5G and 6G networks, communication between devices is going to get a whole lot faster.

Of course, there's also the issue of privacy. You can't just go around sharing sensitive data willy-nilly - especially not in industries like healthcare and finance. That's where FL comes in, providing a way to utilize edge computing power while keeping private data, well, private.

So what does the future hold for FL? More research into improving communication, increasing data transfer, and better coverage, for starters. And with applications ranging from smart cities to medical cyber-physical systems, it's clear that FL is going to be a game-changer."""," In the fast-paced world of technology, federated learning (FL) is gaining popularity as a promising approach for utilizing the computational power of devices on the edge of the network. This paradigm is particularly useful in sensitive applications such as healthcare and finance where privacy is paramount.

For instance, FL enables the creation of digital twins for smart cities, enhances security and privacy in machine learning for IoT, and facilitates credit risk assessment from combined bank records. It's also being explored for autonomous vehicles and manufacturing industries.

However, scalability remains a subject of ongoing research, especially considering the participation of numerous clients in model training within an IoT environment. Future work aims to improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and extend coverage. It is anticipated that future edge devices might leverage 5G and 6G networks for communication.

Sharing private data poses a risk of data leakage and privacy concerns. To address this, federated learning employs techniques to ensure data remains on the device, thereby preserving its integrity. Nevertheless, it's important to note that despite the progress made, there are still open challenges that need to be addressed, such as dealing with non-IID data and communication overhead.

As a business executive, you might find it beneficial to stay updated on these advancements. They could potentially revolutionize your industry by enabling secure, privacy-preserving, and efficient machine learning at the edge of the network."

Digitization increases accessibility, improves communication between healthcare pro- fessionals, and offers better monitoring and transparency in patient care. Health record digitization applications are software tools that enable the digitization and storage of patient health records. Some apps also enable doctor-patient commu- nication, online appointment scheduling and management, and real-time tracking of health data and outcomes. These apps improve patient care treatment efficiency and increase patient satisfaction. The objective of this paper is to design and implement a web-based application that facilitates doctors in maintain- ing and accessing patient records. This digital platform aims to streamline the process of updating individual pa- tient profiles with pertinent health information. The paper will describe the development of both fron- tend and backend technologies. System architecture delineates specific roles for its users, with a particular emphasis on two pri- mary roles: patients and doctors. For patients, the system grants exclusive access to their individual health records. Doctor or caregiver possess the capability to access the records of all pa- tients under their care, including those they have personally added or managed. A paper version of this form is shown in Fig. 3. The pediatric tracheostomy safety checklist is a form that contains a list of measures that the caregiver must check and record on the form. The body map form is a special tool used by healthcare professionals to record important information about a pa- tient’s health. The web app is designed to be simple, clear and intuitive, with an emphasis on usability and accessibility. When registering, the user registers us- ing a simple form, where he must fill in a username, email address and password. The dashboard window contains a pair of graphs that provide information about the vital functions of the patient’s body. Paediatric tracheostomy safety checklist protocol is a list of steps that the caregiver must check and record on the form. In the paper version of the form, the list was divided into seven working days and each day was further divided into day and night shifts. A chronologi- cal record was chosen, where the date and day of the week are added to each record. This approach has made it easier and faster to complete the form without having to manually split the records into days and shifts. The application was developed locally and deployed on the MS Azure cloud platform for testing purposes. a scenario designed to test the editing of the caregiver profile. Our final test scenario is shown in Table 3 and aims totest the possibility of displaying the data to patients. The application was generally positively evaluated, and users had no reserva- tions about the design and functionality.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

**Federated Learning: The Future of Distributed Optimization**

As we continue to push the boundaries of edge computing and IoT, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for utilizing the increasing computational power of devices on the network. But what makes FL different from traditional distributed optimization problems?

For starters, FL involves training data that's specific to each client, which can lead to vastly different data distributions across connected clients. This requires careful scheduling of tasks, particularly when working with IoT devices that have limited computational power.

Scalability is also crucial in FL systems, especially in IoT environments where many clients can participate in model training. And let's not forget about privacy - a key consideration for applications in healthcare and finance, where sharing sensitive data is often impossible.

Our team has been diving deep into the world of FL, exploring its potential in smart cities, edge computing, and more. We're excited about the opportunities it presents, from digital twins to autonomous vehicles.

But we also know that there are challenges to overcome, such as addressing communication overhead, improving data transfer, and ensuring better coverage. As we look to the future, we believe FL will play a critical role in shaping the next generation of IoT applications.

#FederatedLearning #EdgeComputing #IoT #MachineLearning #ArtificialIntelligence #SmartCities"," In the rapidly evolving world of IoT and edge computing, we find ourselves delving deeper into innovative techniques to leverage the immense computational power at the network's edge. One such promising approach is Federated Learning (FL), a paradigm that has been gaining traction due to its potential for privacy-preserving, distributed machine learning.

In FL, many devices collaborate locally to learn a global model without sharing their private data. This approach is particularly beneficial in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance where data sharing is often impossible. However, the scalability of FL systems remains an area of ongoing research as we strive for better communication between devices, increased data transfer efficiency, and broader coverage.

As we look towards the future, edge devices might utilize 5G and 6G networks for communication, enhancing the potential for real-time collaboration in FL scenarios. Nevertheless, concerns about data leakage and privacy remain, necessitating continuous efforts to ensure secure and private training across devices.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles.

Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Federated Learning: A Promising Approach for Edge Computing and IoT Devices

As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to grow, the need for efficient and secure data processing becomes increasingly important. Federated learning (FL), a decentralized approach to machine learning, offers a promising solution. FL enables multiple devices to collaboratively train AI models without sharing their local data, ensuring privacy and security.

However, FL presents several challenges, including scheduling tasks on devices with varying computational power, addressing differences in data distribution, and ensuring scalability. Additionally, communication between devices can be vulnerable to data leakage and privacy issues.

Despite these challenges, FL has shown great potential in various applications, including healthcare informatics, smart city sensing, and autonomous vehicles. Researchers have made significant advances in recent years, exploring new techniques for FL, such as peer-to-peer learning and knowledge distillation.

As edge computing continues to evolve, FL is likely to play a critical role in unlocking its full potential. With the increasing adoption of 5G and 6G networks, FL can enable faster data transfer and better coverage. Moreover, its ability to protect sensitive data makes it an attractive solution for industries such as healthcare and finance.

As the field continues to mature, further studies are needed to improve communication between devices, increase scalability, and enhance privacy protection. Nevertheless, federated learning has already demonstrated its value in various applications, and its potential to transform the way we approach AI and edge computing is undeniable."," The field of Federated Learning (FL) is gaining popularity as it allows for the utilization of the increasing computational power of edge devices in a network. This paradigm is particularly useful for applications that require high levels of privacy and security, such as healthcare or finance, where sharing sensitive data can be impossible or extremely difficult.

The scalability of FL systems is currently a subject of further study, as many clients can participate in model training within an Internet of Things (IoT) environment. Future work aims to improve communication between devices, increase data transfer rates, and provide better coverage. It's possible that future edge devices will leverage the capabilities of 5G and 6G networks for communication.

However, sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy breaches. To address this issue, various strategies are being developed, such as federated learning-based service placement for mobile edge computing and privacy-aware self-learning anomaly detection systems for IoT.

Federated Learning has been applied in numerous areas, including smart cities, cyber-physical systems, manufacturing, autonomous vehicles, credit risk assessment, and medical applications.

Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network.

Digitization increases accessibility, improves communication between healthcare pro- fessionals, and offers better monitoring and transparency in patient care. Health record digitization applications are software tools that enable the digitization and storage of patient health records. Some apps also enable doctor-patient commu- nication, online appointment scheduling and management, and real-time tracking of health data and outcomes. These apps improve patient care treatment efficiency and increase patient satisfaction. The objective of this paper is to design and implement a web-based application that facilitates doctors in maintain- ing and accessing patient records. This digital platform aims to streamline the process of updating individual pa- tient profiles with pertinent health information. The paper will describe the development of both fron- tend and backend technologies. System architecture delineates specific roles for its users, with a particular emphasis on two pri- mary roles: patients and doctors. For patients, the system grants exclusive access to their individual health records. Doctor or caregiver possess the capability to access the records of all pa- tients under their care, including those they have personally added or managed. A paper version of this form is shown in Fig. 3. The pediatric tracheostomy safety checklist is a form that contains a list of measures that the caregiver must check and record on the form. The body map form is a special tool used by healthcare professionals to record important information about a pa- tient’s health. The web app is designed to be simple, clear and intuitive, with an emphasis on usability and accessibility.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues.

In FL, each device trains a model on its own data, and then shares the trained model with others. This process requires careful scheduling, as devices have different computational power and memory sizes. To overcome these challenges, researchers have developed various techniques for asynchronous and synchronous scheduling.

Another key aspect of FL is scalability. As more devices participate in training, the system must be able to handle the increased data transfer and processing demands. Future work could focus on improving communication between devices and increasing data transfer rates.

FL has many potential applications, including healthcare, finance, and smart cities. However, it's essential to ensure that private data is not compromised during the learning process. Researchers have proposed various methods for privacy-preserving FL, such as using blockchain technology or designing secure algorithms.

Recent studies have explored the use of FL in various domains, including edge computing, IoT, and machine learning. Some notable examples include using FL for anomaly detection in smart cities, predicting human mobility patterns, and assessing credit risk in finance.

As we move forward with FL research, it's essential to address the challenges of non-IID data (i.e., data that is not equally distributed among devices). This requires developing new algorithms and techniques for rebalancing and aggregating the trained models.

In conclusion, Federated Learning has tremendous potential to enable collaborative learning among IoT devices while preserving their privacy. As researchers continue to explore this field, we can expect to see innovative applications and advancements in data security and processing.

As you explore the world of artificial intelligence and machine learning, you may have come across the term ""federated learning"" (FL). But what exactly does it mean, and how can it benefit various industries?

In FL, multiple devices or clients collaboratively train a shared model while keeping their data private. This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where data cannot be shared due to privacy concerns, such as in healthcare or finance.

However, FL poses some significant challenges. For instance, the data distribution of connected clients can be quite different from each other, and scheduling tasks becomes crucial when working with devices that have limited computational power.

To overcome these hurdles, researchers are exploring various techniques, including synchronous and asynchronous optimization methods. The goal is to develop highly scalable FL systems that can efficiently communicate between devices and transfer data while ensuring privacy and security.

In the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), FL has immense potential. It can enable digital twins for smart cities, improve edge computing in 6G networks, and enhance applications such as anomaly detection and human mobility prediction.

Moreover, FL is being applied to various fields, including healthcare informatics, autonomous vehicles, and manufacturing. Its benefits are undeniable, but it also raises important questions about data privacy and protection, particularly with regards to regulations like the EU's GDPR and California's CCPA.

As you delve deeper into the world of AI and ML, understanding FL and its implications can help you unlock new possibilities for innovation and growth."," In the world of technology, Federated Learning (FL) is a promising approach that utilizes the computational power of devices on the edge of the network. This paradigm is gaining popularity due to its potential in sensitive areas like healthcare and finance, where data sharing is often impossible.

In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is a subject of further studies, with future work focusing on improving communication between devices, increasing data transfer, and better coverage. The use of 5G and 6G networks for communication might become commonplace among future edge devices.

However, sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy issues. To address this, researchers are exploring ways to maintain privacy while still allowing for effective training. This is crucial because participants train at different times due to varying memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples.

In smart cities, FL enables digital twins, replicas that learn from real-world city data, helping in management and decision-making. Similarly, the concept of Edge Computing in 6G is being studied for its potential use cases and challenges.

Machine Learning (ML) and Blockchain technologies are also being combined to create a decentralized, privacy-preserving, and secure system. This combination aims to address the need for data protection and privacy concerns in various applications.

When it comes to anomaly detection, Non-IID Data Re-Balancing at IoT Edge with Peer-to-Peer Federated Learning is a promising approach. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) are becoming de facto global standards for data privacy and protection.

In the realm of smart cities, FL faces challenges and opportunities in sensing. On-device Federated Learning with Flower is a recent development that could address these challenges.

For secondary school students, this world offers exciting possibilities. From breast density classification to autonomous vehicle control, Federated Learning is making waves across various fields.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network.

Privacy is paramount for applications like healthcare and finance, where sensitive information is typically difficult to share. This article offers an overview of the FL paradigm, a growing area of interest.

In the realm of 6G, Machine Learning (ML) and Blockchain technologies intersect, offering decentralized, privacy-preserving, and secure solutions. Works like Non-IID Data Re-Balancing at IoT Edge with Peer-to-Peer Federated Learning for Anomaly Detection strive to address the challenge of non-identical data distribution across devices.

As global standards, the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) are shaping up as de facto guidelines for data privacy and protection.

FL is being explored in various domains, including smart cities, autonomous vehicles, credit risk assessment, attack detection, collaborative manufacturing, and more. Recent advancements in Edge Computing-Powered Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) are also driving the growth of FL.

Researchers continue to address scalability issues, communication overhead, and non-IID data challenges through innovative solutions like Cooperative Mobile Edge Networking and knowledge distillation. The future of FL is bright as it offers a promising path towards harnessing the collective intelligence of edge devices while preserving privacy and security.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

**Federated Learning: A Promising Approach for Edge Computing**

As we continue to rely on edge computing to process vast amounts of data, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach. FL enables machine learning models to be trained on decentralized data from multiple sources, without sharing sensitive information.

However, FL also presents specific challenges. The training data from each client device may vary significantly due to differences in devices and environments. Moreover, scheduling techniques are crucial to optimize computationally intensive tasks, particularly when working with IoT devices with limited computational power.

To overcome these challenges, researchers have proposed various solutions, including asynchronous federated learning for geospatial applications, scalable and low-latency federated learning for vehicular edge computing, and communication-efficient federated learning via knowledge distillation.

The importance of privacy in FL cannot be overstated. In industries such as healthcare and finance, data sharing is often impossible due to privacy concerns. Therefore, it is essential to develop robust security measures to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information.

As we move forward with Federated Learning, it is crucial that we address these challenges and opportunities head-on. With its potential to revolutionize edge computing, FL holds significant promise for smart cities, IoT applications, and beyond.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Digitization increases accessibility, improves communication between healthcare pro- fessionals, and offers better monitoring and transparency in patient care. Health record digitization applications are software tools that enable the digitization and storage of patient health records. Some apps also enable doctor-patient commu- nication, online appointment scheduling and management, and real-time tracking of health data and outcomes. These apps improve patient care treatment efficiency and increase patient satisfaction. The objective of this paper is to design and implement a web-based application that facilitates doctors in maintain- ing and accessing patient records. This digital platform aims to streamline the process of updating individual pa- tient profiles with pertinent health information. The paper will describe the development of both fron- tend and backend technologies. System architecture delineates specific roles for its users, with a particular emphasis on two pri- mary roles: patients and doctors. For patients, the system grants exclusive access to their individual health records. Doctor or caregiver possess the capability to access the records of all pa- tients under their care, including those they have personally added or managed. A paper version of this form is shown in Fig. 3. The pediatric tracheostomy safety checklist is a form that contains a list of measures that the caregiver must check and record on the form. The body map form is a special tool used by healthcare professionals to record important information about a pa- tient’s health. The web app is designed to be simple, clear and intuitive, with an emphasis on usability and accessibility. When registering, the user registers us- ing a simple form, where he must fill in a username, email address and password. The dashboard window contains a pair of graphs that provide information about the vital functions of the patient’s body. Paediatric tracheostomy safety checklist protocol is a list of steps that the caregiver must check and record on the form. In the paper version of the form, the list was divided into seven working days and each day was further divided into day and night shifts. A chronologi- cal record was chosen, where the date and day of the week are added to each record. This approach has made it easier and faster to complete the form without having to manually split the records into days and shifts. The application was developed locally and deployed on the MS Azure cloud platform for testing purposes. a scenario designed to test the editing of the caregiver profile. Our final test scenario is shown in Table 3 and aims totest the possibility of displaying the data to patients. The application was generally positively evaluated, and users had no reserva- tions about the design and functionality. The graph high- lights that the application was stable and operated effectively. we developed an efficient system for storing information from medical records. Finally, using the React.js and Express.js frameworks, we successfully created a web application dedicated to digitizing records. The application uses the MongoDB database for safe and efficient data storage.

It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

Digitization increases accessibility, improves communication between healthcare pro- fessionals, and offers better monitoring and transparency in patient care. Health record digitization applications are software tools that enable the digitization and storage of patient health records. Some apps also enable doctor-patient commu- nication, online appointment scheduling and management, and real-time tracking of health data and outcomes. These apps improve patient care treatment efficiency and increase patient satisfaction. The objective of this paper is to design and implement a web-based application that facilitates doctors in maintain- ing and accessing patient records. This digital platform aims to streamline the process of updating individual pa- tient profiles with pertinent health information. The paper will describe the development of both fron- tend and backend technologies. System architecture delineates specific roles for its users, with a particular emphasis on two pri- mary roles: patients and doctors. For patients, the system grants exclusive access to their individual health records. Doctor or caregiver possess the capability to access the records of all pa- tients under their care, including those they have personally added or managed. A paper version of this form is shown in Fig. 3. The pediatric tracheostomy safety checklist is a form that contains a list of measures that the caregiver must check and record on the form. The body map form is a special tool used by healthcare professionals to record important information about a pa- tient’s health. The web app is designed to be simple, clear and intuitive, with an emphasis on usability and accessibility. When registering, the user registers us- ing a simple form, where he must fill in a username, email address and password. The dashboard window contains a pair of graphs that provide information about the vital functions of the patient’s body. Paediatric tracheostomy safety checklist protocol is a list of steps that the caregiver must check and record on the form. In the paper version of the form, the list was divided into seven working days and each day was further divided into day and night shifts. A chronologi- cal record was chosen, where the date and day of the week are added to each record. This approach has made it easier and faster to complete the form without having to manually split the records into days and shifts. The application was developed locally and deployed on the MS Azure cloud platform for testing purposes. a scenario designed to test the editing of the caregiver profile. Our final test scenario is shown in Table 3 and aims totest the possibility of displaying the data to patients. The application was generally positively evaluated, and users had no reserva- tions about the design and functionality. The graph high- lights that the application was stable and operated effectively. we developed an efficient system for storing information from medical records. Finally, using the React.js and Express.js frameworks, we successfully created a web application dedicated to digitizing records. The application uses the MongoDB database for safe and efficient data storage.

In traditional distributed optimization problems, data is aggregated on a central server. But FL flips this script by enabling training on decentralized devices, such as smartphones or smart home devices, without sharing their private data. This is especially crucial in industries like healthcare and finance, where data privacy is paramount.

However, FL presents its own set of challenges, including:

* Scheduling tasks efficiently to accommodate varying computational power and memory sizes
* Ensuring scalability to handle large numbers of clients
* Addressing communication overhead and data leakage risks

Despite these hurdles, the benefits of FL are undeniable. By harnessing the collective power of edge devices, we can create more accurate models, reduce latency, and unlock new use cases in smart cities, healthcare, and beyond.

I'm excited to see where this technology takes us, particularly with the advent of 5G and 6G networks. The future of AI is decentralized, and FL is leading the charge.

#FederatedLearning #EdgeAI #IoT #MachineLearning #PrivacyPreserving #SmartCities #HealthcareTech"," In the rapidly evolving world of technology, Federated Learning (FL) is a promising approach that leverages the computational power of devices at the edge of the network. FL allows these devices to collaboratively learn models without sharing sensitive data, making it particularly useful for industries like healthcare and finance where privacy is paramount.

With the advent of IoT, more clients are participating in model training, making scalability a critical aspect that researchers are focusing on. Future advancements could enhance communication between devices, increase data transfer rates, and expand coverage. It's possible that edge devices will utilize 5G and future 6G networks for seamless communication.

However, sharing private data comes with risks such as potential data leakage and privacy breaches. To mitigate these concerns, federated learning employs various techniques to protect sensitive information while ensuring efficient model training.

The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) are becoming de facto global standards for data privacy and protection. These regulations emphasize transparency, consent, and individual control over personal data.

In the realm of IoT, federated learning can drive the development of digital twins for smart cities, enabling real-time insights and optimized resource allocation. It's also playing a crucial role in areas like anomaly detection, credit risk assessment, attack detection, collaborative manufacturing, autonomous vehicle control, and more.

As an entrepreneur interested in AIoT (Artificial Intelligence of Things), it's essential to stay updated on the latest advances in federated learning. From non-IID data rebalancing to communication-efficient federated learning methods, numerous research papers are addressing these challenges head-on.

Although FL methods offer several advantages, including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices with limited computational resources. Federated learning (FL) is a complex method for handling distributed data training. It enables the cooperative training of high-quality joint models by combining and averaging locally calculated updates submitted by IoT devices. FL has been used in many applications, including medical, Industry 5.0 and IoT, mobile applications, or transportation. The literature does not consider the challenges related to hardware requirements. The article explores the applications and future directions of federated learning in communication and networking. They partially describe the possibilities of deploying AI at the network’s edge, where they list edge devices on which these calculations for AI can be performed. The article focuses on a systematic overview of the technology and methods used in FL and EC. FL is an emerging machine learning system that aims to address the problem of data privacy. It involves multiple clients (such as mobile devices, institutions, organizations, etc.) coordinated with one central or multiple servers that are decentralized. Several states, countries, and companies have been increasingly concerned about data privacy in recent years. There are two types of architecture in FL: centralized and decentralized. Centralized learning is so far deﬁned as the most accurate. However, it has its disadvantages in terms of privacy and security. Communication problems can also represent a graph with time and latency constraints. distributed learning in FL systems, concentrating on IoT cybersecurity within this context. Analysis primarily focuses on security but highlights new difﬁculties and emerging research patterns. FL framework is based on a decentralized server, or the so-called blockchain. user privacy, as their input data remains on the de- vice and only individual weights and parameter gradients are shared. Because clients send updates to their local training parameters to the FL server, they are the most vulnerable attack surface in the FL system. According to experimental ﬁndings, privacy is not a property of inherent collaborative learning algorithms such as FL.  vertical FL is more challenging to implement than horizontal FL because each machine learning algorithm requires a speciﬁc learning protocol to be created. Vertical FL is better suited for joint model training between large businesses because it has a broader range of applications. There are several frameworks and open-source software options available for FL. FATE-Flow. It is used for inference processing, modeling, training, veriﬁcation, and publishing. FATEBoard is a tool to visualize individual ML models, explore them and understand them more easily. The last element that contains the FATE framework is KubeFATE. This element is used to deploy FATE using cloud technologies such as Kubernetes. Clients that participate in the training of the global model. PySyft creates and uses automatic differential privacy to provide strong privacy guarantees to data users. SecFL performs global and local training inside enclaves of Trusted Execution Environments to ensure the integrity of computations against strong adversaries with privileged access. TFF achieves the best feature accuracy on a distributed dataset with ﬁve clients at 49.20%. Not all FL technologies are used in open-source frameworks. Leading companies have built proprietary libraries supplied under a restricted license and not open source. Flower and PySyft have ofﬁcial support for ARM architectures, according to the documentation. We also looked at the possibilities of deploying these frameworks at the network’s edge and on edge devices. FL can be applied in several real-world situations. There are many cases where FL can be used in the Industry 4.0 or Industry 5.0. It makes sense for industrial engineering to adopt FL applications in response to FL’s success in protecting data privacy. For banking, FL needs to be modiﬁed to address several real-world issues. FL can be used to train ML models in vehicles based on their datasets, such as road geometry, collision avoidance, trafﬁc ﬂow, and data from all the sensors available in modern vehicles. FL could facilitate the development of different types of IoT applications in vehicles. The use of FL for security is increasingly required in the ﬁnancial and healthcare sectors. in smart city applications [113] 2019 Industry Utilize FL in an industrial setting for tasks related to visual inspection of products. 2022 Industry Use of FL in the manufacture of components for aerospace companies. 2019 Healthcare Differential private learning for electronic health records via FL [118] 2021 Healthcare Demonstration and adaptation of FL techniques for healthcare and electronic systems in healthcare. Edge devices with limited resources can be found in today’s IoT and industry world. These limitations may be due to size or due to cost. In EC it is possible to use several types of devices that can be deployed at the edge of the network. Communication overhead is the main cause of the increased communication overhead. Reducing the number of communicating devices, the total number of communication rounds, and the size of the model update are the keys to reducing the communication overhead in FL. Heterogeneous FL clients’ limited power or memory capacity and energy consumption can cause speciﬁc issues. The training data of each client in FL depends to a large extent on the use of speciﬁc local devices. The data distribution of connected clients may be quite different from each other. Federated optimization has several key characteristics that distinguish it from a typical distributed optimization problem. Scheduling Techniques Due to the wide use of computationally intensive tasks and applications, it is nec- essary to address the scheduling of tasks. Existing scheduling optimization techniques can be divided into synchronous and asynchronous. Fl requires caution while scheduling procedures, particularly when working with IoT devices that have constrained computational power. The FL process must be highly scalable. In an IoT environment, many clients can participate in model training. Scalability of FL systems is the subject of further studies. Future work could improve communication between devices, increase data transfer, and better coverage. It is possible that future edge devices will use the 5G and 6G networks for communication. Sharing private data makes the network vulnerable to data leakage and privacy. Different participants train at noticeably different times due to the various memory sizes and availability, affecting the number of data samples. Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa- tional power of the devices on the edge of the network. Privacy is key for applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing these data are often impossible.

The objective of this paper is to design and implement a web-based application that facilitates doctors in maintain- ing and accessing patient records. This digital platform aims to streamline the process of updating individual pa- tient profiles with pertinent health information. The paper will describe the development of both fron- tend and backend technologies. System architecture delineates specific roles for its users, with a particular emphasis on two pri- mary roles: patients and doctors. For patients, the system grants exclusive access to their individual health records. Doctor or caregiver possess the capability to access the records of all pa- tients under their care, including those they have personally added or managed. A paper version of this form is shown in Fig. 3. The pediatric tracheostomy safety checklist is a form that contains a list of measures that the caregiver must check and record on the form. The body map form is a special tool used by healthcare professionals to record important information about a pa- tient’s health. The web app is designed to be simple, clear and intuitive, with an emphasis on usability and accessibility. When registering, the user registers us- ing a simple form, where he must fill in a username, email address and password. The dashboard window contains a pair of graphs that provide information about the vital functions of the patient’s body. Paediatric tracheostomy safety checklist protocol is a list of steps that the caregiver must check and record on the form. In the paper version of the form, the list was divided into seven working days and each day was further divided into day and night shifts. A chronologi- cal record was chosen, where the date and day of the week are added to each record. This approach has made it easier and faster to complete the form without having to manually split the records into days and shifts. The application was developed locally and deployed on the MS Azure cloud platform for testing purposes. a scenario designed to test the editing of the caregiver profile. Our final test scenario is shown in Table 3 and aims totest the possibility of displaying the data to patients. The application was generally positively evaluated, and users had no reserva- tions about the design and functionality. The graph high- lights that the application was stable and operated effectively. we developed an efficient system for storing information from medical records. Finally, using the React.js and Express.js frameworks, we successfully created a web application dedicated to digitizing records. The application uses the MongoDB database for safe and efficient data storage.
