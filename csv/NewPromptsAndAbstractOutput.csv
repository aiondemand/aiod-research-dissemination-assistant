IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

ferent commercially available Edge AI accelerators. We see a huge variety of devices based on different chips, running
different operating systems, and utilizing different AI frame-
works/runtimes. While manufacturers of all of the devices
mentioned above were able to specify the theoretical max
performance of the devices, usually, they were not able to
specify the power draw of the SBC. It is hard to make even an
educated guess on which edge devices should be used for the
specific deployment in such an environment. It is even harder
when we consider framework-specific optimizations. Another
question is the devices’ limits, for example: Are all the devices
able to run 3D convolutional networks? If not, is it due to the
intrinsic limitations of the chip design or due to the lack of
computing power? We do not know the answer to any of those
questions now.
We believe that there is a need to examine these devices
further and preferably create some kind of guidelines on
how, when, and where to deploy AI applications to achieve
maximum efficiency and low costs. In the process, it is
also necessary to introduce a more objective and less naive
division than only boards/sticks as the board category is still
vast. In order to do so, it is needed to compare them and
preferably create some curated benchmark that would be able
to encompass a significant portion of such devices. This,
however, will mean incorporating a wide variety of different

New technologies bring opportunities to deploy AI and machine learning to the edge of
the network, allowing edge devices to train simple models that can then be deployed in practice.
Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique to create a global model by
learning from multiple decentralized edge clients. Although FL methods offer several advantages,
including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of
computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. Internet of Things (IoT) devices
may have limited computing resources, poorer connection quality, or may use different operating
systems. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices
with limited computational resources. This paper also presents FL frameworks that are currently
popular and that provide communication between clients and servers. In this context, various topics
are described, which include contributions and trends in the literature. This includes basic models
and designs of system architecture, possibilities of application in practice, privacy and security, and
resource management. Challenges related to the computational requirements of edge devices such as
hardware heterogeneity, communication overload or limited resources of devices are discussed.

8. Conclusions
Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa-
tional power of the devices on the edge of the network and the large and diverse datasets
to train machine learning models without compromising data privacy. Privacy is key for
applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing
these data are often impossible. Before these architectures are widely used in commonplace
applications, many research questions still need to be resolved, despite a few examples of
FL being successfully used in production settings. FL has become a cutting-edge paradigm
in response to the growing computational power of devices such as smartphones, wear-
ables, and autonomous cars, as well as worries about the security of sensitive data. Due
to the increased need for local data storage and the relocation of ML computations to end
devices while minimizing data transfer overhead, researchers have tried to implement FL
architectures in various domains. An overview of the FL paradigm, which is gaining popu-
larity, is provided in this article. We focused on the most recent materials and publications,
as we discussed FL’s fundamental architecture, communication, design, and analysis. We
discussed the basic requirements that FL must meet, the difﬁculties involved, the potential

ating systems they supported and the potential for deployment on various edge devices.

New technologies bring opportunities to deploy AI and machine learning to the edge of
the network, allowing edge devices to train simple models that can then be deployed in practice.
Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique to create a global model by
learning from multiple decentralized edge clients. Although FL methods offer several advantages,
including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of
computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. Internet of Things (IoT) devices
may have limited computing resources, poorer connection quality, or may use different operating
systems. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices
with limited computational resources. This paper also presents FL frameworks that are currently
popular and that provide communication between clients and servers. In this context, various topics
are described, which include contributions and trends in the literature. This includes basic models
and designs of system architecture, possibilities of application in practice, privacy and security, and
resource management. Challenges related to the computational requirements of edge devices such as
hardware heterogeneity, communication overload or limited resources of devices are discussed.

8. Conclusions
Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa-
tional power of the devices on the edge of the network and the large and diverse datasets
to train machine learning models without compromising data privacy. Privacy is key for
applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing
these data are often impossible. Before these architectures are widely used in commonplace
applications, many research questions still need to be resolved, despite a few examples of
FL being successfully used in production settings. FL has become a cutting-edge paradigm
in response to the growing computational power of devices such as smartphones, wear-
ables, and autonomous cars, as well as worries about the security of sensitive data. Due
to the increased need for local data storage and the relocation of ML computations to end
devices while minimizing data transfer overhead, researchers have tried to implement FL

IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this article, we have provided a brief overview of dif-
ferent commercially available Edge AI accelerators. We see a huge variety of devices based on different chips, running
different operating systems, and utilizing different AI frame-
works/runtimes. While manufacturers of all of the devices
mentioned above were able to specify the theoretical max
performance of the devices, usually, they were not able to
specify the power draw of the SBC. It is hard to make even an
educated guess on which edge devices should be used for the
specific deployment in such an environment. It is even harder
when we consider framework-specific optimizations. Another
question is the devices’ limits, for example: Are all the devices
able to run 3D convolutional networks? If not, is it due to the
intrinsic limitations of the chip design or due to the lack of
computing power? We do not know the answer to any of those
questions now.
We believe that there is a need to examine these devices
further and preferably create some kind of guidelines on
how, when, and where to deploy AI applications to achieve
maximum efficiency and low costs. In the process, it is
also necessary to introduce a more objective and less naive
division than only boards/sticks as the board category is still
vast. In order to do so, it is needed to compare them and
preferably create some curated benchmark that would be able
to encompass a significant portion of such devices. This,
however, will mean incorporating a wide variety of different

IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this article, we have provided a brief overview of dif-
ferent commercially available Edge AI accelerators. We see a huge variety of devices based on different chips, running
different operating systems, and utilizing different AI frame-
works/runtimes. While manufacturers of all of the devices
mentioned above were able to specify the theoretical max
performance of the devices, usually, they were not able to
specify the power draw of the SBC. It is hard to make even an
educated guess on which edge devices should be used for the
specific deployment in such an environment. It is even harder
when we consider framework-specific optimizations. Another
question is the devices’ limits, for example: Are all the devices
able to run 3D convolutional networks? If not, is it due to the
intrinsic limitations of the chip design or due to the lack of
computing power? We do not know the answer to any of those
questions now.
We believe that there is a need to examine these devices
further and preferably create some kind of guidelines on
how, when, and where to deploy AI applications to achieve
maximum efficiency and low costs. In the process, it is
also necessary to introduce a more objective and less naive
division than only boards/sticks as the board category is still
vast. In order to do so, it is needed to compare them and
preferably create some curated benchmark that would be able
to encompass a significant portion of such devices. This,
however, will mean incorporating a wide variety of different

New technologies bring opportunities to deploy AI and machine learning to the edge of
the network, allowing edge devices to train simple models that can then be deployed in practice.
Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique to create a global model by
learning from multiple decentralized edge clients. Although FL methods offer several advantages,
including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of
computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. Internet of Things (IoT) devices
may have limited computing resources, poorer connection quality, or may use different operating
systems. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices
with limited computational resources. This paper also presents FL frameworks that are currently
popular and that provide communication between clients and servers. In this context, various topics
are described, which include contributions and trends in the literature. This includes basic models
and designs of system architecture, possibilities of application in practice, privacy and security, and
resource management. Challenges related to the computational requirements of edge devices such as
hardware heterogeneity, communication overload or limited resources of devices are discussed.

8. Conclusions
Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa-
tional power of the devices on the edge of the network and the large and diverse datasets
to train machine learning models without compromising data privacy. Privacy is key for
applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing
these data are often impossible. Before these architectures are widely used in commonplace
applications, many research questions still need to be resolved, despite a few examples of
FL being successfully used in production settings. FL has become a cutting-edge paradigm
in response to the growing computational power of devices such as smartphones, wear-
ables, and autonomous cars, as well as worries about the security of sensitive data. Due
to the increased need for local data storage and the relocation of ML computations to end
devices while minimizing data transfer overhead, researchers have tried to implement FL
architectures in various domains. An overview of the FL paradigm, which is gaining popu-
larity, is provided in this article. We focused on the most recent materials and publications,
as we discussed FL’s fundamental architecture, communication, design, and analysis. We
discussed the basic requirements that FL must meet, the difﬁculties involved, the potential

New technologies bring opportunities to deploy AI and machine learning to the edge of
the network, allowing edge devices to train simple models that can then be deployed in practice.
Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique to create a global model by
learning from multiple decentralized edge clients. Although FL methods offer several advantages,
including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of
computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. Internet of Things (IoT) devices
may have limited computing resources, poorer connection quality, or may use different operating
systems. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices
with limited computational resources. This paper also presents FL frameworks that are currently
popular and that provide communication between clients and servers. In this context, various topics
are described, which include contributions and trends in the literature. This includes basic models
and designs of system architecture, possibilities of application in practice, privacy and security, and
resource management. Challenges related to the computational requirements of edge devices such as
hardware heterogeneity, communication overload or limited resources of devices are discussed.

8. Conclusions
Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa-
tional power of the devices on the edge of the network and the large and diverse datasets
to train machine learning models without compromising data privacy. Privacy is key for
applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing
these data are often impossible. Before these architectures are widely used in commonplace
applications, many research questions still need to be resolved, despite a few examples of
FL being successfully used in production settings. FL has become a cutting-edge paradigm
in response to the growing computational power of devices such as smartphones, wear-
ables, and autonomous cars, as well as worries about the security of sensitive data. Due
to the increased need for local data storage and the relocation of ML computations to end
devices while minimizing data transfer overhead, researchers have tried to implement FL
architectures in various domains. An overview of the FL paradigm, which is gaining popu-
larity, is provided in this article. We focused on the most recent materials and publications,

IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this article, we have provided a brief overview of dif-
ferent commercially available Edge AI accelerators. We see a huge variety of devices based on different chips, running
different operating systems, and utilizing different AI frame-
works/runtimes. While manufacturers of all of the devices
mentioned above were able to specify the theoretical max
performance of the devices, usually, they were not able to
specify the power draw of the SBC. It is hard to make even an
educated guess on which edge devices should be used for the
specific deployment in such an environment. It is even harder
when we consider framework-specific optimizations. Another
question is the devices’ limits, for example: Are all the devices
able to run 3D convolutional networks? If not, is it due to the
intrinsic limitations of the chip design or due to the lack of
computing power? We do not know the answer to any of those
questions now.
We believe that there is a need to examine these devices
further and preferably create some kind of guidelines on
how, when, and where to deploy AI applications to achieve
maximum efficiency and low costs. In the process, it is
also necessary to introduce a more objective and less naive
division than only boards/sticks as the board category is still
vast. In order to do so, it is needed to compare them and
preferably create some curated benchmark that would be able
to encompass a significant portion of such devices. This,

The AI Revolution at the Edge: A Call to Action for Business Executives

In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has experienced unprecedented growth, particularly in deep learning. However, deploying these models in real-time environments with limited computational power and energy resources remains a significant challenge. To overcome this hurdle, specialized hardware known as AI Accelerators have emerged.

These accelerators utilize diverse technologies to enhance performance. A recent survey of commercially available Edge AI accelerators revealed a vast array of devices based on different chips, operating systems, and AI frameworks. While manufacturers can specify theoretical maximum performance, they often fail to provide power draw specifications for these devices. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to determine the most suitable device for specific deployments.

Furthermore, questions surrounding the devices' limits persist. Can all devices support 3D convolutional networks? Are limitations due to chip design or computing power constraints? The answers to these questions remain elusive.

There is a pressing need to further examine these devices and establish guidelines for deploying AI applications efficiently and cost-effectively. A more nuanced classification system, moving beyond the simple board category, is essential. This will require comparing devices and creating curated benchmarks that encompass a significant portion of available options.

The future of Edge AI deployment hinges on our ability to address these challenges. By doing so, we can unlock the full potential of AI and drive business success in various industries."," In the recent years, there has been an unprecedented surge in the realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with deep learning being a standout segment. The models employed in deep learning are typically computationally intensive and challenging to execute promptly in settings with computational and energy constraints.

learning from multiple decentralized edge clients. Although FL methods offer several advantages,
including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of
computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. Internet of Things (IoT) devices
may have limited computing resources, poorer connection quality, or may use different operating
systems. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices

IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this article, we have provided a brief overview of dif-
ferent commercially available Edge AI accelerators. We see a huge variety of devices based on different chips, running
different operating systems, and utilizing different AI frame-
works/runtimes. While manufacturers of all of the devices
mentioned above were able to specify the theoretical max
performance of the devices, usually, they were not able to
specify the power draw of the SBC. It is hard to make even an
educated guess on which edge devices should be used for the
specific deployment in such an environment. It is even harder
when we consider framework-specific optimizations. Another
question is the devices’ limits, for example: Are all the devices
able to run 3D convolutional networks? If not, is it due to the
intrinsic limitations of the chip design or due to the lack of
computing power? We do not know the answer to any of those
questions now.
We believe that there is a need to examine these devices

how, when, and where to deploy AI applications to achieve
maximum efficiency and low costs. In the process, it is
also necessary to introduce a more objective and less naive
division than only boards/sticks as the board category is still
vast. In order to do so, it is needed to compare them and

including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of
computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. Internet of Things (IoT) devices
may have limited computing resources, poorer connection quality, or may use different operating
systems. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices

To overcome this hurdle, AI Accelerators have emerged as specialized hardware that can help speed up processing. But what are these accelerators? In this post, I'll give you an overview of commercially available Edge AI accelerators that operate within electrical energy constraints.

In recent years, we've seen a plethora of devices emerge, each with its unique features and capabilities. From different chips to operating systems and AI frameworks/runtimes, it's like trying to navigate a maze!

Let me summarize: these devices are designed to accelerate processing in real-time environments. But here's the catch - manufacturers often don't provide power consumption data for these devices. That makes it difficult to determine which one to use for a specific deployment.

Moreover, when we consider framework-specific optimizations and device limits (like running 3D convolutional networks), things get even more complicated. We don't have answers to these questions yet!

So what's the takeaway? I believe there's a need to further examine these devices and develop guidelines on how, when, and where to deploy AI applications for maximum efficiency and low costs.

IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this article, we have provided a brief overview of dif-
ferent commercially available Edge AI accelerators. We see a huge variety of devices based on different chips, running
different operating systems, and utilizing different AI frame-
works/runtimes. While manufacturers of all of the devices
mentioned above were able to specify the theoretical max
performance of the devices, usually, they were not able to
specify the power draw of the SBC. It is hard to make even an
educated guess on which edge devices should be used for the
specific deployment in such an environment. It is even harder
when we consider framework-specific optimizations. Another
question is the devices’ limits, for example: Are all the devices
able to run 3D convolutional networks? If not, is it due to the
intrinsic limitations of the chip design or due to the lack of
computing power? We do not know the answer to any of those
questions now.
We believe that there is a need to examine these devices
further and preferably create some kind of guidelines on
how, when, and where to deploy AI applications to achieve
maximum efficiency and low costs. In the process, it is
also necessary to introduce a more objective and less naive
division than only boards/sticks as the board category is still
vast. In order to do so, it is needed to compare them and
preferably create some curated benchmark that would be able
to encompass a significant portion of such devices. This,

New technologies bring opportunities to deploy AI and machine learning to the edge of
the network, allowing edge devices to train simple models that can then be deployed in practice.
Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique to create a global model by
learning from multiple decentralized edge clients. Although FL methods offer several advantages,
including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of
computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. Internet of Things (IoT) devices
may have limited computing resources, poorer connection quality, or may use different operating
systems. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices
with limited computational resources. This paper also presents FL frameworks that are currently
popular and that provide communication between clients and servers. In this context, various topics
are described, which include contributions and trends in the literature. This includes basic models
and designs of system architecture, possibilities of application in practice, privacy and security, and
resource management. Challenges related to the computational requirements of edge devices such as
hardware heterogeneity, communication overload or limited resources of devices are discussed.

8. Conclusions
Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa-
tional power of the devices on the edge of the network and the large and diverse datasets
to train machine learning models without compromising data privacy. Privacy is key for
applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing
these data are often impossible. Before these architectures are widely used in commonplace
applications, many research questions still need to be resolved, despite a few examples of
FL being successfully used in production settings. FL has become a cutting-edge paradigm
in response to the growing computational power of devices such as smartphones, wear-
ables, and autonomous cars, as well as worries about the security of sensitive data. Due
to the increased need for local data storage and the relocation of ML computations to end
devices while minimizing data transfer overhead, researchers have tried to implement FL
architectures in various domains. An overview of the FL paradigm, which is gaining popu-
larity, is provided in this article. We focused on the most recent materials and publications,
as we discussed FL’s fundamental architecture, communication, design, and analysis. We
discussed the basic requirements that FL must meet, the difﬁculties involved, the potential

for deployment and use in practical applications, and the frameworks with which FL is
compatible. We have focused on the overview of the frameworks and examined the oper-
ating systems they supported and the potential for deployment on various edge devices.
We discussed potential future directions for FL use in diverse IoT environments. We also

speciﬁcations they employ are not always listed in the literature.","Here's a LinkedIn post summarizing the text:

when we consider framework-specific optimizations. Another
question is the devices’ limits, for example: Are all the devices

New technologies bring opportunities to deploy AI and machine learning to the edge of
the network, allowing edge devices to train simple models that can then be deployed in practice.
Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique to create a global model by
learning from multiple decentralized edge clients. Although FL methods offer several advantages,
including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of
computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. Internet of Things (IoT) devices
may have limited computing resources, poorer connection quality, or may use different operating
systems. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices
with limited computational resources. This paper also presents FL frameworks that are currently
popular and that provide communication between clients and servers. In this context, various topics
are described, which include contributions and trends in the literature. This includes basic models
and designs of system architecture, possibilities of application in practice, privacy and security, and
resource management. Challenges related to the computational requirements of edge devices such as
hardware heterogeneity, communication overload or limited resources of devices are discussed.

8. Conclusions
Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa-
tional power of the devices on the edge of the network and the large and diverse datasets
to train machine learning models without compromising data privacy. Privacy is key for
applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing
these data are often impossible. Before these architectures are widely used in commonplace
applications, many research questions still need to be resolved, despite a few examples of
FL being successfully used in production settings. FL has become a cutting-edge paradigm
in response to the growing computational power of devices such as smartphones, wear-
ables, and autonomous cars, as well as worries about the security of sensitive data. Due
to the increased need for local data storage and the relocation of ML computations to end
devices while minimizing data transfer overhead, researchers have tried to implement FL
architectures in various domains. An overview of the FL paradigm, which is gaining popu-
larity, is provided in this article. We focused on the most recent materials and publications,
as we discussed FL’s fundamental architecture, communication, design, and analysis. We
discussed the basic requirements that FL must meet, the difﬁculties involved, the potential

Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique to create a global model by
learning from multiple decentralized edge clients. Although FL methods offer several advantages,
including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of
computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. Internet of Things (IoT) devices
may have limited computing resources, poorer connection quality, or may use different operating
systems. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices
with limited computational resources. This paper also presents FL frameworks that are currently
popular and that provide communication between clients and servers. In this context, various topics
are described, which include contributions and trends in the literature. This includes basic models
and designs of system architecture, possibilities of application in practice, privacy and security, and
resource management. Challenges related to the computational requirements of edge devices such as
hardware heterogeneity, communication overload or limited resources of devices are discussed.

8. Conclusions
Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa-
tional power of the devices on the edge of the network and the large and diverse datasets
to train machine learning models without compromising data privacy. Privacy is key for
applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing
these data are often impossible. Before these architectures are widely used in commonplace
applications, many research questions still need to be resolved, despite a few examples of
FL being successfully used in production settings. FL has become a cutting-edge paradigm
in response to the growing computational power of devices such as smartphones, wear-
ables, and autonomous cars, as well as worries about the security of sensitive data. Due
to the increased need for local data storage and the relocation of ML computations to end
devices while minimizing data transfer overhead, researchers have tried to implement FL
architectures in various domains. An overview of the FL paradigm, which is gaining popu-
larity, is provided in this article. We focused on the most recent materials and publications,
as we discussed FL’s fundamental architecture, communication, design, and analysis. We
discussed the basic requirements that FL must meet, the difﬁculties involved, the potential

for deployment and use in practical applications, and the frameworks with which FL is
compatible. We have focused on the overview of the frameworks and examined the oper-
ating systems they supported and the potential for deployment on various edge devices.
We discussed potential future directions for FL use in diverse IoT environments. We also
considered the problems and difﬁculties that must be solved for edge devices that are
resource-constrained and have limited computational power, even though the hardware
speciﬁcations they employ are not always listed in the literature.","**The Future of AI: Unlocking the Power of Federated Learning at the Edge**

performance of the devices, usually, they were not able to
specify the power draw of the SBC. It is hard to make even an
educated guess on which edge devices should be used for the
specific deployment in such an environment. It is even harder
when we consider framework-specific optimizations. Another
question is the devices’ limits, for example: Are all the devices
able to run 3D convolutional networks? If not, is it due to the
intrinsic limitations of the chip design or due to the lack of
computing power? We do not know the answer to any of those
questions now.
We believe that there is a need to examine these devices
further and preferably create some kind of guidelines on
how, when, and where to deploy AI applications to achieve
maximum efficiency and low costs. In the process, it is
also necessary to introduce a more objective and less naive
division than only boards/sticks as the board category is still
vast. In order to do so, it is needed to compare them and
preferably create some curated benchmark that would be able
to encompass a significant portion of such devices. This,

Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique to create a global model by
learning from multiple decentralized edge clients. Although FL methods offer several advantages,
including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of
computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. Internet of Things (IoT) devices
may have limited computing resources, poorer connection quality, or may use different operating
systems. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices
with limited computational resources. This paper also presents FL frameworks that are currently
popular and that provide communication between clients and servers. In this context, various topics
are described, which include contributions and trends in the literature. This includes basic models
and designs of system architecture, possibilities of application in practice, privacy and security, and
resource management. Challenges related to the computational requirements of edge devices such as
hardware heterogeneity, communication overload or limited resources of devices are discussed.

8. Conclusions
Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa-
tional power of the devices on the edge of the network and the large and diverse datasets
to train machine learning models without compromising data privacy. Privacy is key for
applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing
these data are often impossible. Before these architectures are widely used in commonplace
applications, many research questions still need to be resolved, despite a few examples of
FL being successfully used in production settings. FL has become a cutting-edge paradigm
in response to the growing computational power of devices such as smartphones, wear-
ables, and autonomous cars, as well as worries about the security of sensitive data. Due
to the increased need for local data storage and the relocation of ML computations to end
devices while minimizing data transfer overhead, researchers have tried to implement FL
architectures in various domains. An overview of the FL paradigm, which is gaining popu-
larity, is provided in this article. We focused on the most recent materials and publications,
as we discussed FL’s fundamental architecture, communication, design, and analysis. We
discussed the basic requirements that FL must meet, the difﬁculties involved, the potential

IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

different operating systems, and utilizing different AI frame-

specify the power draw of the SBC. It is hard to make even an
educated guess on which edge devices should be used for the
specific deployment in such an environment. It is even harder
when we consider framework-specific optimizations. Another
question is the devices’ limits, for example: Are all the devices
able to run 3D convolutional networks? If not, is it due to the
intrinsic limitations of the chip design or due to the lack of
computing power? We do not know the answer to any of those
questions now.

also necessary to introduce a more objective and less naive
division than only boards/sticks as the board category is still
vast. In order to do so, it is needed to compare them and
preferably create some curated benchmark that would be able
to encompass a significant portion of such devices. This,

8. CONCLUSIONS
We have performed a analysis of modern technologies
relevant to the development of web applications. This in-
cludes an overview of the tools and frameworks for digi-
tizing health records. During the development process, we
encountered and solved various challenges, including front-
end issues related to design and user interface, as well as
back-end issues related to application architecture and inte-
gration between front-end and back-end components.
A thorough review of the paper forms was conducted,

IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this article, we have provided a brief overview of dif-
ferent commercially available Edge AI accelerators. We see a huge variety of devices based on different chips, running
different operating systems, and utilizing different AI frame-
works/runtimes. While manufacturers of all of the devices
mentioned above were able to specify the theoretical max
performance of the devices, usually, they were not able to
specify the power draw of the SBC. It is hard to make even an
educated guess on which edge devices should be used for the
specific deployment in such an environment. It is even harder
when we consider framework-specific optimizations. Another
question is the devices’ limits, for example: Are all the devices
able to run 3D convolutional networks? If not, is it due to the
intrinsic limitations of the chip design or due to the lack of
computing power? We do not know the answer to any of those
questions now.
We believe that there is a need to examine these devices
further and preferably create some kind of guidelines on
how, when, and where to deploy AI applications to achieve
maximum efficiency and low costs. In the process, it is
also necessary to introduce a more objective and less naive
division than only boards/sticks as the board category is still
vast. In order to do so, it is needed to compare them and
preferably create some curated benchmark that would be able
to encompass a significant portion of such devices. This,
however, will mean incorporating a wide variety of different
frameworks and runtimes.","Here's a LinkedIn post summarizing the text:

""As AI professionals, we're excited to share our findings on the latest developments in Edge AI accelerators.

These devices come in various forms, using different technologies and operating systems. However, manufacturers often fail to provide crucial information on power consumption, making it difficult to select the right device for a specific deployment.

We believe there's a need for further examination of these devices and guidelines on how to deploy AI applications efficiently. To achieve this, we propose comparing devices and creating curated benchmarks that encompass a wide range of devices, frameworks, and runtimes.

#AIHardware #EdgeComputing #DeepLearning"""," In the last few years, we've witnessed a significant growth in AI, particularly deep learning. However, these advanced models can be expensive to run and challenging to execute in environments with limited computational resources.

These devices use different chips, operating systems, and AI frameworks/runtimes. Unfortunately, manufacturers aren't always able to specify the power draw of these devices, making it difficult to choose the right one for specific deployments. This is especially true when considering framework-specific optimizations.

Another concern is whether all devices can handle 3D convolutional networks. The answer isn't clear yet. To address these challenges, we believe it's crucial to examine these devices further and establish guidelines on how, where, and when to deploy AI applications for maximum efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

It's also important to categorize these devices more objectively, as the current board category is too vast. This would involve comparing them and ideally creating a curated benchmark that can encompass a significant number of such devices. However, this would require incorporating a wide variety of different frameworks and runtimes.

New technologies bring opportunities to deploy AI and machine learning to the edge of
the network, allowing edge devices to train simple models that can then be deployed in practice.
Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique to create a global model by
learning from multiple decentralized edge clients. Although FL methods offer several advantages,
including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of
computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. Internet of Things (IoT) devices
may have limited computing resources, poorer connection quality, or may use different operating
systems. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices
with limited computational resources. This paper also presents FL frameworks that are currently
popular and that provide communication between clients and servers. In this context, various topics
are described, which include contributions and trends in the literature. This includes basic models
and designs of system architecture, possibilities of application in practice, privacy and security, and
resource management. Challenges related to the computational requirements of edge devices such as
hardware heterogeneity, communication overload or limited resources of devices are discussed.

8. Conclusions
Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa-
tional power of the devices on the edge of the network and the large and diverse datasets
to train machine learning models without compromising data privacy. Privacy is key for
applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing
these data are often impossible. Before these architectures are widely used in commonplace
applications, many research questions still need to be resolved, despite a few examples of
FL being successfully used in production settings. FL has become a cutting-edge paradigm
in response to the growing computational power of devices such as smartphones, wear-
ables, and autonomous cars, as well as worries about the security of sensitive data. Due
to the increased need for local data storage and the relocation of ML computations to end
devices while minimizing data transfer overhead, researchers have tried to implement FL
architectures in various domains. An overview of the FL paradigm, which is gaining popu-
larity, is provided in this article. We focused on the most recent materials and publications,

Hey everyone! I just finished reading an article about something called Federated Learning (FL). It's like a super cool way to make machines learn new things without sharing too much data. You know how sometimes we have devices that can do lots of calculations, like smartphones or computers? Well, FL is a way to use those devices to train machine learning models without sending all the data to one place.

Imagine if your smartphone could learn from all the people around it, and then make decisions based on what it learned. That's basically what FL does! It takes lots of small calculations from many devices and puts them together to create something new.

learning from multiple decentralized edge clients. Although FL methods offer several advantages,
including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of
computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. Internet of Things (IoT) devices
may have limited computing resources, poorer connection quality, or may use different operating
systems. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices
with limited computational resources. This paper also presents FL frameworks that are currently
popular and that provide communication between clients and servers. In this context, various topics
are described, which include contributions and trends in the literature. This includes basic models
and designs of system architecture, possibilities of application in practice, privacy and security, and
resource management. Challenges related to the computational requirements of edge devices such as
hardware heterogeneity, communication overload or limited resources of devices are discussed.

tional power of the devices on the edge of the network and the large and diverse datasets
to train machine learning models without compromising data privacy. Privacy is key for
applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing
these data are often impossible. Before these architectures are widely used in commonplace
applications, many research questions still need to be resolved, despite a few examples of
FL being successfully used in production settings. FL has become a cutting-edge paradigm

As you may know, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has experienced a significant boom in recent years, particularly with Deep Learning. However, executing these models in real-time can be challenging due to computational and energetic constraints. To overcome this issue, specialized hardware called AI Accelerators are often used.

But what exactly are AI Accelerators? They encompass a wide variety of devices using different technologies. In fact, there's such a vast range that it's hard to make an informed decision on which device to use for a specific deployment. This is because most manufacturers only provide the theoretical maximum performance of their devices, without specifying the power draw.

As you can imagine, this makes it difficult to determine the best edge AI accelerator for your needs. Another challenge is understanding the limitations of each device. For instance, can all devices run 3D convolutional networks? If not, is it due to the chip design or lack of computing power?

It's clear that there's a need for further examination and guidelines on how to deploy AI applications efficiently and cost-effectively. To achieve this, we need to compare different edge AI accelerators, frameworks, and runtimes. This would require creating a curated benchmark that encompasses a significant portion of these devices.

The takeaway is that there's no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to choosing the right edge AI accelerator for your project. It's essential to consider various factors, including power consumption, computing power, and framework-specific optimizations.

**Edge AI Accelerators: A Review of Commercially Available Options**

As a researcher in the field of Artificial Intelligence, I'm excited to share my latest findings on Edge AI accelerators. In recent years, there has been an explosion of interest in AI, particularly in deep learning. However, executing these models in real-time environments with computational and energetic constraints can be challenging.

To overcome this challenge, specialized hardware such as AI Accelerators is often employed. These devices use various technologies and are designed to accelerate the processing of AI workloads. In my recent study, I surveyed the market and gathered information on commercially available Edge AI accelerators that operate within electrical energy constraints.

What did I find? A vast array of devices from different manufacturers, each using unique chips, operating systems, and AI frameworks/runtimes. While these devices offer impressive theoretical performance capabilities, specifying their power draw is often lacking. This makes it difficult to determine which device is best suited for a specific deployment environment.

Furthermore, there are questions regarding the limits of these devices. For instance, can they run 3D convolutional networks? If not, is this due to chip design limitations or lack of computing power? Unfortunately, I do not have answers to these questions yet.

In my opinion, it is crucial to conduct a more in-depth examination of these devices and develop guidelines on how, when, and where to deploy AI applications to achieve maximum efficiency and low costs. This will require comparing devices, creating curated benchmarks that encompass a significant portion of available options, and incorporating various AI frameworks and runtimes.

New technologies bring opportunities to deploy AI and machine learning to the edge of
the network, allowing edge devices to train simple models that can then be deployed in practice.
Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique to create a global model by
learning from multiple decentralized edge clients. Although FL methods offer several advantages,
including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of
computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. Internet of Things (IoT) devices
may have limited computing resources, poorer connection quality, or may use different operating
systems. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices
with limited computational resources. This paper also presents FL frameworks that are currently
popular and that provide communication between clients and servers. In this context, various topics

New technologies bring opportunities to deploy AI and machine learning to the edge of
the network, allowing edge devices to train simple models that can then be deployed in practice.
Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique to create a global model by
learning from multiple decentralized edge clients. Although FL methods offer several advantages,
including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of
computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. Internet of Things (IoT) devices
may have limited computing resources, poorer connection quality, or may use different operating
systems. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices
with limited computational resources. This paper also presents FL frameworks that are currently
popular and that provide communication between clients and servers. In this context, various topics
are described, which include contributions and trends in the literature. This includes basic models
and designs of system architecture, possibilities of application in practice, privacy and security, and

hardware heterogeneity, communication overload or limited resources of devices are discussed.

8. Conclusions
Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa-
tional power of the devices on the edge of the network and the large and diverse datasets
to train machine learning models without compromising data privacy. Privacy is key for
applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing
these data are often impossible. Before these architectures are widely used in commonplace
applications, many research questions still need to be resolved, despite a few examples of
FL being successfully used in production settings. FL has become a cutting-edge paradigm
in response to the growing computational power of devices such as smartphones, wear-
ables, and autonomous cars, as well as worries about the security of sensitive data. Due
to the increased need for local data storage and the relocation of ML computations to end
devices while minimizing data transfer overhead, researchers have tried to implement FL

the network, allowing edge devices to train simple models that can then be deployed in practice.
Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique to create a global model by
learning from multiple decentralized edge clients. Although FL methods offer several advantages,
including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of
computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. Internet of Things (IoT) devices
may have limited computing resources, poorer connection quality, or may use different operating
systems. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices
with limited computational resources. This paper also presents FL frameworks that are currently
popular and that provide communication between clients and servers. In this context, various topics
are described, which include contributions and trends in the literature. This includes basic models
and designs of system architecture, possibilities of application in practice, privacy and security, and
resource management. Challenges related to the computational requirements of edge devices such as
hardware heterogeneity, communication overload or limited resources of devices are discussed.

8. Conclusions
Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa-
tional power of the devices on the edge of the network and the large and diverse datasets
to train machine learning models without compromising data privacy. Privacy is key for
applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing
these data are often impossible. Before these architectures are widely used in commonplace
applications, many research questions still need to be resolved, despite a few examples of
FL being successfully used in production settings. FL has become a cutting-edge paradigm
in response to the growing computational power of devices such as smartphones, wear-
ables, and autonomous cars, as well as worries about the security of sensitive data. Due
to the increased need for local data storage and the relocation of ML computations to end
devices while minimizing data transfer overhead, researchers have tried to implement FL
architectures in various domains. An overview of the FL paradigm, which is gaining popu-
larity, is provided in this article. We focused on the most recent materials and publications,
as we discussed FL’s fundamental architecture, communication, design, and analysis. We
discussed the basic requirements that FL must meet, the difﬁculties involved, the potential

for deployment and use in practical applications, and the frameworks with which FL is
compatible. We have focused on the overview of the frameworks and examined the oper-
ating systems they supported and the potential for deployment on various edge devices.
We discussed potential future directions for FL use in diverse IoT environments. We also
considered the problems and difﬁculties that must be solved for edge devices that are
resource-constrained and have limited computational power, even though the hardware

different operating systems, and utilizing different AI frame-

question is the devices’ limits, for example: Are all the devices

New technologies bring opportunities to deploy AI and machine learning to the edge of
the network, allowing edge devices to train simple models that can then be deployed in practice.
Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique to create a global model by
learning from multiple decentralized edge clients. Although FL methods offer several advantages,
including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of
computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. Internet of Things (IoT) devices
may have limited computing resources, poorer connection quality, or may use different operating
systems. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices
with limited computational resources. This paper also presents FL frameworks that are currently
popular and that provide communication between clients and servers. In this context, various topics
are described, which include contributions and trends in the literature. This includes basic models
and designs of system architecture, possibilities of application in practice, privacy and security, and
resource management. Challenges related to the computational requirements of edge devices such as
hardware heterogeneity, communication overload or limited resources of devices are discussed.

8. Conclusions
Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa-
tional power of the devices on the edge of the network and the large and diverse datasets
to train machine learning models without compromising data privacy. Privacy is key for
applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing
these data are often impossible. Before these architectures are widely used in commonplace
applications, many research questions still need to be resolved, despite a few examples of
FL being successfully used in production settings. FL has become a cutting-edge paradigm
in response to the growing computational power of devices such as smartphones, wear-
ables, and autonomous cars, as well as worries about the security of sensitive data. Due
to the increased need for local data storage and the relocation of ML computations to end
devices while minimizing data transfer overhead, researchers have tried to implement FL
architectures in various domains. An overview of the FL paradigm, which is gaining popu-
larity, is provided in this article. We focused on the most recent materials and publications,

including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of
computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. Internet of Things (IoT) devices
may have limited computing resources, poorer connection quality, or may use different operating
systems. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices
with limited computational resources. This paper also presents FL frameworks that are currently
popular and that provide communication between clients and servers. In this context, various topics
are described, which include contributions and trends in the literature. This includes basic models
and designs of system architecture, possibilities of application in practice, privacy and security, and
resource management. Challenges related to the computational requirements of edge devices such as
hardware heterogeneity, communication overload or limited resources of devices are discussed.

8. Conclusions
Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa-
tional power of the devices on the edge of the network and the large and diverse datasets
to train machine learning models without compromising data privacy. Privacy is key for
applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing
these data are often impossible. Before these architectures are widely used in commonplace
applications, many research questions still need to be resolved, despite a few examples of
FL being successfully used in production settings. FL has become a cutting-edge paradigm
in response to the growing computational power of devices such as smartphones, wear-
ables, and autonomous cars, as well as worries about the security of sensitive data. Due
to the increased need for local data storage and the relocation of ML computations to end
devices while minimizing data transfer overhead, researchers have tried to implement FL
architectures in various domains. An overview of the FL paradigm, which is gaining popu-
larity, is provided in this article. We focused on the most recent materials and publications,
as we discussed FL’s fundamental architecture, communication, design, and analysis. We
discussed the basic requirements that FL must meet, the difﬁculties involved, the potential

boom in the field of AI, and particularly in a subset called
deep learning. The models used in deep learning are often
relatively computationally expensive and problematic to execute
in real-time in environments with computational and energetic

AI Accelerators are often utilized. The term AI Accelerators
encompass a wide variety of different devices using different
technologies. This work surveys a market and introduces an
overview of such accelerators for a network’s edge constrained

IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this article, we have provided a brief overview of dif-
ferent commercially available Edge AI accelerators. We see a huge variety of devices based on different chips, running
different operating systems, and utilizing different AI frame-
works/runtimes. While manufacturers of all of the devices
mentioned above were able to specify the theoretical max
performance of the devices, usually, they were not able to
specify the power draw of the SBC. It is hard to make even an
educated guess on which edge devices should be used for the
specific deployment in such an environment. It is even harder
when we consider framework-specific optimizations. Another
question is the devices’ limits, for example: Are all the devices
able to run 3D convolutional networks? If not, is it due to the
intrinsic limitations of the chip design or due to the lack of
computing power? We do not know the answer to any of those
questions now.
We believe that there is a need to examine these devices
further and preferably create some kind of guidelines on
how, when, and where to deploy AI applications to achieve
maximum efficiency and low costs. In the process, it is
also necessary to introduce a more objective and less naive
division than only boards/sticks as the board category is still
vast. In order to do so, it is needed to compare them and
preferably create some curated benchmark that would be able
to encompass a significant portion of such devices. This,
however, will mean incorporating a wide variety of different
frameworks and runtimes.","Here's a LinkedIn post summarizing the text:

New technologies bring opportunities to deploy AI and machine learning to the edge of
the network, allowing edge devices to train simple models that can then be deployed in practice.
Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique to create a global model by
learning from multiple decentralized edge clients. Although FL methods offer several advantages,
including scalability and data privacy, they also introduce some risks and drawbacks in terms of
computational complexity in the case of heterogeneous devices. Internet of Things (IoT) devices
may have limited computing resources, poorer connection quality, or may use different operating
systems. This paper provides an overview of the methods used in FL with a focus on edge devices
with limited computational resources. This paper also presents FL frameworks that are currently
popular and that provide communication between clients and servers. In this context, various topics
are described, which include contributions and trends in the literature. This includes basic models
and designs of system architecture, possibilities of application in practice, privacy and security, and
resource management. Challenges related to the computational requirements of edge devices such as
hardware heterogeneity, communication overload or limited resources of devices are discussed.

8. Conclusions
Federated learning is a promising approach for utilizing the ever-increasing computa-
tional power of the devices on the edge of the network and the large and diverse datasets
to train machine learning models without compromising data privacy. Privacy is key for
applications in healthcare or ﬁnance, as they are inherently extremely sensitive and sharing
these data are often impossible. Before these architectures are widely used in commonplace
applications, many research questions still need to be resolved, despite a few examples of
FL being successfully used in production settings. FL has become a cutting-edge paradigm
in response to the growing computational power of devices such as smartphones, wear-
ables, and autonomous cars, as well as worries about the security of sensitive data. Due
to the increased need for local data storage and the relocation of ML computations to end
devices while minimizing data transfer overhead, researchers have tried to implement FL
architectures in various domains. An overview of the FL paradigm, which is gaining popu-
larity, is provided in this article. We focused on the most recent materials and publications,
as we discussed FL’s fundamental architecture, communication, design, and analysis. We
discussed the basic requirements that FL must meet, the difﬁculties involved, the potential

for deployment and use in practical applications, and the frameworks with which FL is
compatible. We have focused on the overview of the frameworks and examined the oper-
ating systems they supported and the potential for deployment on various edge devices.
We discussed potential future directions for FL use in diverse IoT environments. We also
considered the problems and difﬁculties that must be solved for edge devices that are
resource-constrained and have limited computational power, even though the hardware
