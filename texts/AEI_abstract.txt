ABSTRACT
This article explores the impact and benefits of digitizing health records, focusing on the care of patients lying at home in the UK.
Although electronic health records (EHRs) have existed for some time, their widespread adoption has escalated in the last decade,
revolutionizing patient care. Digitization of health records increases accessibility, improves communication between healthcare pro-
fessionals, and offers better monitoring and transparency in patient care. Through a case study of implementing a digital solution for
patients and doctors, this article aims to show how such technological advances can significantly improve patient care, reduce costs,
and provide peace of mind for patients’ families.
8. CONCLUSIONS
We have performed a analysis of modern technologies
relevant to the development of web applications. This in-
cludes an overview of the tools and frameworks for digi-
tizing health records. During the development process, we
encountered and solved various challenges, including front-
end issues related to design and user interface, as well as
back-end issues related to application architecture and inte-
gration between front-end and back-end components.
A thorough review of the paper forms was conducted,
focusing on the details and intricacies of the information
fields. After this analysis, we started designing and proto-
typing the web application so that its architecture and func-
tionalities meet the required standards. This phase also in-
cluded rigorous testing of the application’s functions.
Subsequently, we developed an efficient system for
storing information from medical records. Finally, using
the React.js and Express.js frameworks, we successfully
created a web application dedicated to digitizing medical
records. The application uses the MongoDB database for
safe and efficient data storage. This paper highlights the
advancements in web application development and enables
the provision of a functional and user-friendly digital solu-
tion for health record management.
